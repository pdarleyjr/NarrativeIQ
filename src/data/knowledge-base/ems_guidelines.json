      "content": "National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines  \n \n  Rev. March  2022  \n 6 \nVersion 3.0 \nIntroduction  \nWe are honored to present the third edition of the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) \nNational Model EMS Clinical Guidelines and want to thank the entire EMS community for contributing to its \nevolution.  The inaugural edition , released in September 2014, has been warmly welcomed by EMS \nclinicians, agencies, medical directors, and healthcare organizations in our nation as well as abroad.  The \ncreation of this document is a pinnacle event in the practice of EMS medicine as it ful filled a \nrecommendation in  The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical Services at the Crossroads  published \nby the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academies of Sciences) in 2007.  Specifically, this report \nstates “NHTSA, in partnership with prof essional organizations, should convene a panel of individuals with \nmultidisciplinary expertise to develop  evidence -based model prehospital care protocols for the treatment, \ntriage, and transport of patients.”   \nThe National Association of State EMS Official s (NASEMSO) recognizes the need for national EMS clinical \nguidelines to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the practice of patient care \nnow and, as experience dictates, the adoption of future practices.  The value of EMS clinician s to the patient \nhas no boundaries as magnified by the historic 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic as well as other \ninterjurisdictional and global responses.  Model EMS clinical guidelines promote uniformity in EMS medicine \nwhich, in turn, fosters a  more consi stent skilled practice as EMS clinicians move across healthcare \nsystems.  They also provide a standard to EMS medical directors upon which to base practice.  Supported by \ninitial and subsequent grant funding from NHTSA ’s Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS ) and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau’s EMS for Children \nprogram, NASEMSO  continues to authorize its Medical Directors Council to partner with national \nstakeholder organizations with expertise i n EMS medical direction and subject matter experts to create a \nunified set of patient care guidelines.  For those aspects of clinical care where evidence -based guidelines \nderived in accordance with the national evidence -based guideline model process were no t available, \nconsensus -based clinical guidelines are developed utilizing current available research .  \nThe NASEMSO Model EMS Clinical Guidelines are not mandatory, are not meant to be all -inclusive,  nor are \nthey meant to determine local scope of practice.  The focus of these guidelines is solely patient -centric.  As \nsuch, they are designed to provide a resource for EMS clinical practice, appropriate patient care, safety of \npatients and clinicians, and outcomes regardless of the existing resources and capabilities within an EMS \nsystem.  This document provides a clinical standard that can be used as is or adapted for use on a state, \nregional, local, or  organizational  level to enhance patient care and to se t benchmark performance of EMS \npractice.  The Guidelines should be adapted to align with federal, state, regional, and jurisdictional laws and \nregulations. NASEMSO’s ongoing support of this project underlines the critical evolution of the model EMS \nclinical  guidelines as new EMS research and evidence -based patient care measures emerge.    \nWe are most grateful to be able to partner with a group of talented, committed individuals in this \nworthwhile endeavor.   \n \nCarol Cunningham, M.D.    Richard Kamin, M.D.  \nCo-Principal Investigator    Co-Principal Investigator\n \n \n"

      "content": "National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines  \n \n  Rev. March  2022  \n 7 \nVersion 3.0 \nPurpose and Notes  \nThese guidelines are intended to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the \npractice of patient care, and to encompass evidence -based guidelines (EBG) as they are developed.  \nThe long -term goal is to develop a full range of evidence -based clinical guidelines for the practice of EMS  \nmedicine . However, until there is a sufficient body of evidence to fully support this goal, there is a need for \nthis interim expert, consensus -based step.  \nThe National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines can fill a significant gap in uniform clinical guidance for EMS \npatient care, while also providing input to the evidence -based guideline (EBG) development process.  \nThese guidelines will be maintained by the Medical Directors Council of the National Association of State \nEMS Officials (NASEMSO) and will be reviewed and updated periodically. As EBG material is developed, it \nwill be substituted for the consensus -based guidelines now comprising the majority of the content of this \ndocument . In the interim, additional consensus -based guidelines will also be ad ded as the need is identified . \nFor guidelines to be considered for inclusion, they must be presented in the format followed by all \nguidelines in the document.  \nUniversal Care and Poisoning/Overdose Universal Care guidelines are included to reduce the need f or \nextensive reiteration of basic assessment and other considerations in every guideline.  \nThe appendices contain material such as neurologic status assessment and burn assessment tools to which \nmany guidelines refer to increase consistency in internal standardization and to reduce duplication.  \nWhile some specific guidelines have been included for pediatric patients, considerations of patient age and \nsize (pediatric, geriatric,  and bariatric) have been interwoven in the guidelines throughout the  document.  \nWhere IV access and drug routing are specified, it is intended to include IO access and drug routing when IV \naccess and drug routing is not possible.  \nGeneric medication names are utilized throughout the guidelines. A complete list of these, alon g with \nrespective brand names, may be found in Appendix III . “Medications”.  \nAccurate and quality data collection is crucial to the advancement of EMS and a critical element of EMS \nresearch . The National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) has the unique abilit y to unify EMS data on a \nnational scope to fulfill this need . Each guideline, therefore, is also listed by the closest NEMSIS Version 3 \nLabel and Code corresponding to it, listed in parentheses below the guideline name.  \nQuality assurance (QA) and/or contin ued performance improvement (CPI) programs are an indispensable \nelement of medical direction as they facilitate the identification of gaps and potential avenues of their \nresolution within an EMS system . The National EMS Quality Alliance ( NEMSQA ) Performanc e Measures is a \nresource for these programs. This edition of the NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines \nincorporates many of the NEMSQA performance measures into the key performance measures associated \nwith each clinical guideline.  \n \n \n"

March  2022  \n 8 \nVersion 3.0 \nTarget Audience  \nWhile this material is intended to be integrated into an EMS system’s operational guidance materials by its \nmedical director and other leaders, it is written with the intention that it will be consumed by field EMS \nclinicians .  \nTo the degree possible, it has been assembled in a format useful for guidance and quick reference so that \nleaders may adopt it in wh ole or in part, harvesting and integrating as they deem appropriate to the format \nof their guideline, protocol, or procedure materials.  \nAny set of guidelines must determine a balance between education and patient care. This document \npurposefully focuses on  the patient care aspect of EMS response . This does not preclude the individual \nmedical director  from using these guidelines and including additional education  as well as incorporation of \nstate, local, or jurisdictional operational procedures . \n \nWhat is New in the 2022 Edition  \nAll of the 2017 guidelines have been reviewed and updated, and additional guidelines and new evidence -\nbased guidelines have been added to this edition . While some of the new material has been added as \nguidelines in the appropriate c hapter, other topics have been incorporated into a previously existing \nguideline . New guidelines have been added to the 2022 edition for the following clinical conditions or \nscenarios:  \n• Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) & Acute Events in Infants  \n• Resuscitation in Traumatic Cardiac Arrest  \n• Tracheostomy Management  \n• Trauma Mass Casualty Incident  \n \nIn addition, with the permission and assistance of the American College of Surgeons – Committee on \nTrauma, we have included the 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients  as Appendix \nIX. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nThe authors of this document are NASEMSO Medical Director Council members partnered with \nrepresentatives of seven EMS medical director stakeholder organizations .

The information provided during the transfer of care should include, but is not limited to,  \na. Patient’s full na me \nb. Age \nc. Chief complaint  \nd. History of present illness/Mechanism of injury  \ne. Past medical history  \nf. Medications  \ng. Allergies  \nh. Vital signs with documented times  \ni. Patient assessment and interventions along with the timing of any medication or \nintervention and the patien t’s response to such interventions  \n5. The verbal or abbreviated written run report provided at the time of transfer of care does not \ntake the place of or negate the requirement for the provision of a complete electronic or \nwritten medical record of the care p rovided by EMS personnel  \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. Routine use of lights and sirens is not warranted  \n2. Even when lights and sirens are in use, always limit speeds to level that is safe for the \nemergency vehicle being driven and road conditions on which it is being operated  \n3. Be aware of legal issues and patient rights as they pertain to and impact patient care ( e.g.,  \npatients with functional needs or children with special healthcare needs)  \n4. Be aware of potential need to adjust management based on pati ent age and comorbidities, \nincluding medication dosages  \n5. The maximum weight -based dose of medication administered to a pediatric patient should not \nexceed the maximum adult dose except where specifically stated in a patient care guideline  \n6. Medical direction  should be contacted when mandated or as needed  \n7. Consider air medical transport, if available, for patients with time -critical conditions where \nground transport time exceeds 30 minutes  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Pediatrics : use a weight -based assessment tool (length -based tape or other system) to estimate \npatient weight and guide medication therapy and adjunct choice  \na. Although the defined age varies by state, the pediatric population is generally defined by \nthose patients who weigh up to 40 kg or up to 14  years of age , whichever comes first  \nb. Consider using the pediatric assessment triangle (appearance, work of breathing, \ncirculation) when first approaching a child to help with assessment  \n2. Geriatrics : although the defined age varies by state, th e geriatric population is generally defined \nas those patients who are 65 years old or more  \na. In these patients, as well as all adult patients, reduced medication dosages may apply to \npatients with renal disease ( i.e., on dialysis or a diagnosis of chronic re nal insufficiency) or \nhepatic disease (i.e. , severe cirrhosis or end -stage liver disease)  \n \n \n"

Co-morbidities : reduced medication dosages may apply to patients with renal disease ( i.e., on \ndialysis or a diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency) or hepatic disease ( i.e., severe cirrhosis or \nend-stage liver disease)  \n4. Vital Signs : \na. Oxygen  \ni. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 9 4–98% saturation  \nii. Supplemental oxygen admini stration is warranted to patients with oxygen saturations \nbelow this level and titrated based upon clinical condition, clinical response, and \ngeographic location and altitude  \niii. The method of oxygen delivery should minimize or treat hypercarbia associated with \nhypoventilation (e.g., non -invasive positive airway pressure devices)  \nb. Normal vital signs (See Table 1. Normal Vital Signs ) \ni. Hypotension is considered a systolic blood pressure less than the lower limit on the \nchart \nii. Tachycardia is considered a pulse above the upper limit on the chart  \niii. Bradycardia is considered a pulse below the lower limit on the chart  \niv. Tachypnea is considered a respiratory rate above the upper limit on the chart  \nv. Bradypnea is considered a respiratory  rate below the lower limit on the chart  \nc. Hypertension. Although abnormal, may be an expected finding in many patients  \ni. Unless an intervention is specifically suggested based on the patient’s complaint or \npresentation, the hypertension should be documented, but otherwise, no intervention \nshould be taken acutely to normalize the blood pressure  \nii. The occurrence of symptoms ( e.g.,  chest pain, dyspnea, vision change, headache, focal \nweakness or change in sensation, altered mental status) in patients with hypertension \nshould be considered concerning, and care should be provided appropriate with the \npatient’s complaint or presentation  \n5. Secondary S urvey : if patient has critical primary survey problems, it may not be possible to \ncomplete  \n6. Critical Patients : proactive patient management should occur simultaneously with assessment  \na. Ideally, one clinician  should be assigned to exclusively mon itor and facilitate patient -\nfocused care  \nb. Other than lifesaving interventions that prevent deterioration en route, t reatment and \nInterventions should be initiated as soon as practical, but should not impede extrication or \ndelay transport to definitive care  \n7. Air Medical Transport : air transport of trauma patients should generally be reserved for higher \nacuity trauma patients where there is a significant time sav ed over ground transport, where the \nappropriate destination is not accessible by ground due to syste mic or logistical issues, and for \npatients who meet the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS -COT)  2022 \nNational Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients  anatomic, physiologic, a nd situational \nhigh -acuity triage criteria . In selected circumstances, air medical resources may be helpful for \nnon-trauma care (e.g., stroke, STEMI when geographically constrained)  \n8. Additional Protective Measures for the EMS Clinician: Due to suspected or con firmed hazards \nand/or highly infectious contagious diseases, traditional patient treatment and care delivery \nmay be altered due to recommendations by federal, state, local or jurisdictional officials  \n \n \n \n"

Competency is generally a legal status of a person’s ability to make \ndecisions. However, state laws vary in the definition of competency and its impact upon authority. \nTherefore, one should consult with the respective state EMS office for clarificat ion on legal definitions and \npatient rights . \n \nPatient Management  \nAssessment  \n1. Decision -Making Capacity  \na. An individual who is alert, oriented, and can understand the circumstances surrounding \nhis/her illness or impairment, as well as the possible risks associated with refusing \ntreatment and/or transport, typically is considered to have decision -making capacity  \nb. The individual’s judgment must also not be significantly impaired by illness, injury,  or \ndrugs/alcohol intoxication. Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal \nintent, or had other factors that lead EMS clinician s to suspect suicidal intent, should not be \nregarded as having decisio n-making capacity and may not decline transport to a medical \nfacility  \n \nTreatment and Interventions  \n1. Obtain a complete set of vital signs and complete an initial assessment, paying particular \nattention to the individual’s neurologic and mental status  \n2. Determi ne the individual’s capacity to make a valid judgment concerning the extent of his/her \nillness or injury; if the EMS clinician  has doubts about whether the individual has the mental \ncapacity to refuse or if the patient lacks capacity, the EMS clinician  should contact medical \ndirection  \n3. If patient has capacity, clearly explain to the individual and all responsible parties the possible \nrisks and overall concerns with regards to refusing care  and that they may reengage the EMS \nsystem if needed  \n4. Perform appropria te medical care with the consent of the individual  \n5. Complete the patient care report clearly documenting the initial assessment findings and the \ndiscussions with all involved individuals regarding the possible consequences of refusing \nadditional prehospital  care and/or transportation  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. An adult or emancipated minor who has demonstrated possessing sufficient mental capacity for \nmaking decisions has the right to determine the course of his/her medical care, including the \nrefusal of care  \n \n \n"

Individuals must be advised of the risks and consequences resulting from refusal of medical care  \nto enable an informed decision  regarding consent or refusal of treatment  \n3. An individual determined to lack decision -making capacit y by EMS clinician s should not be \nallowed to refuse care against medical advice or to be released at the scene. Mental illness, \ndrugs, alcohol intoxication, or physical/mental impairment may significantly impair an \nindividual’s decision -making capacity. In dividuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized \nsuicidal intent, or had other factors that lead EMS clinician s to suspect suicidal intent, should \nnot be regarded as having demonstrated sufficient decision -making capacity  \n4. The determination of decision -maki ng capacity may be challenged by communication barriers \nor cultural differences  \n5. EMS clinician s should not put themselves in danger by attempting to treat and/or transport an \nindividual who refuses care . Law enforcement personnel should be requested if needed  \n6. Always act in the best interest of the patient . EMS clinician s, with the support of direct medical \noversight, must strike a balance between abandoning the patient and forcing care  \n7. Special Considerations – Minors  \nIt is preferable for min ors to have a parent or legal guardian who can provide consent for \ntreatment on behalf of the child  \na. All states allow healthcare clinician s to provide emergency treatment when a parent is not \navailable to provide consent. This is known as the emergency exception rule or the doctrine \nof implied consent. For minors, this doctrine means that the EMS clinician can presume \nconsent and proceed wit h appropriate treatment and transport if the following six \nconditions are met:  \ni. The child is suffering from an emergent condition that places their  life or health in \ndanger  \nii. The child’s legal guardian is unavailable or unable to provide consent for treatment  or \ntransport  \niii. Treatment or transport cannot be safely delayed until consent can be obtained  \niv. The EMS clinician administers only treatment for emergency conditions that pose an \nimmediate threat to the child  \nv. As a rule , when the EMS clinician ’s authority to ac t is in doubt, EMS clinician s should \nalways do what they believe to be in the best interest of the minor  \nvi. If a minor is injured or ill and no parent contact is possible, the EMS clinician  may \ncontact medical direction  for additional instructions  \n \nQuality Improvement  \nAssociated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01)  (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) \n• 9914189 – General  - Refusal of Care  \n \nKey Documentation Elements  \n• Document p atient capacity with:  \no All barriers to patient care in the NEMSIS element “eHistory.01 —Barriers to Patient Care” (a \nRequired National Element of NEMSIS)  \no Exam fields for “eExam.19 —Mental Status” and “eExam.20 —Neurological Assessment”  \no Vitals for level of responsiveness and Glasgow Coma Scale  \no Alcohol and drug use indicators  \n \n \n"

Patients suffering from syncope due to arrhythmia may experience recurrent arrhythmias and \nshould therefore be placed on a cardiac monitor  \n2. Geriatric patients suffering falls from standing may sustain significant injury and should be \ndiligently screened for trauma . [General Trauma Management  Guideline ] \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. By being most proximate to the scene and to the patient’s presentation, EMS clinician s are \ncommonly in a unique position to identify the cause of syncope. Consideration of potential \ncauses, ongoing monitoring of vitals and cardiac rhythm and detailed exam and history are \nessential pieces of information to pass on  to hospital clinician s  \n2. For patients where a lower risk etiology is suspected, e.g., vasovagal syncope, decisions \nregarding delayed or non -transport should be made in consultation with medical dire ction  \n3. High -risk causes of syncope include , but are not limited to,  the following:   \na. Cardiovascular  \ni. Myocardial infarction   \nii. Aortic stenosis   \niii. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (consider in young patient with unexplained syncope \nduring exertion)   \niv. Pulmonary embolus    \nv. Aortic dissection    \nvi. Dysrhythmia    \nvii.

The EKG may be transmitted for remote interpretation by a physician or screened for \nSTEMI by properly trained EMS clinician s or other healthcare providers  with or without \nthe assistance of computer -interpretation   \nb. Advance notification should be provided to  the receiving hospital for patients identified as \nhaving a STEMI   \nc. Performance of serial EKGs is encouraged for symptomatic patients with EKGs initially non -\ndiagnostic for STEMI    \nd. All EKGs should be made available to treating personnel at the receiving hospital, whether \nhand delivered as hard copy or transmitted from the field   \n5. Administer aspirin; chewable, non -enteric -coated aspirin preferred (162 –325 mg)   \n6. Establish IV access   \n7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual (SL) , can repeat q  (quaque, every)  3–5 minutes if SBP greater \nthan 100 mmHg  \na. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase \ninhibitor within the past 48 hours   \nb. Examples include  sildenafil (Viagra®,  Revatio®), vardenafil (Levitra®,  Staxyn®), tadalafil \n(Cialis®,  Adcirca®) which are used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. \nAlso avoid use in patients receiving intravenous  epoprostenol  (Flolan®) \nor treporstenil  (Remo dulin®) which is used for pulmonary hypertension   \nc. Care should always be taken when giving nitroglycerin when the patient’s blood pressure \nis marginal.  If used in this setting , the clinician  should weigh the risk and benefit of nitrate \nadministration over the administration of an opiate analgesic and be ready to respond to \nhypotension with fluid bolus or  pressor  \n8. The location of the infarct does not preclude the use of nitrates. Right -sided leads are of no \nadditional value if an inferior STEMI has been diagn osed and such findings (presumed RV \ninfarct) do not preclude the use of nitroglycerin : however, continually monitor the patient’s \nhemodynamic status and be prepared to resuscitate  if hypotension occurs   \n9. If the pain is unresponsive to nitrates , opiates are an acceptable alternative . Morphine should \nbe used with caution in unstable angina (UA)/non -STEMI due to an association with increased \nmortality   \n10.

Observe for signs of decreased end -organ perfusion: chest pain (CP), shortness of breath (SOB), \ndecreased level of consciousness, syncope,  or other signs of shock/hy potension    \n2. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine    \n3. Consider potential culprit medications including beta -blockers, calcium channel blockers, \nsodium channel blockers/anti -depressants, digoxin, and clonidine   \na. If medication overdose is considered, refer to appropriate guideline in the  Toxins and \nEnvironmental  Section   \n4. The differential diagnosis includes the following: myocardial infarction (MI) , hypoxia , pacemaker \nfailure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial \npressure (ICP) , stroke , spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, cholinergic \nnerve agents   \n5. Consider  hyperkalemia  in the patient with  wide complex bradycardia   \n6. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as \nneeded   \na. Third -degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond \nto atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to  chronotropic  agents (such as epinephrine \nor dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing   \nb. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients  \nc. In cases of impending hemodynamic collapse, proceed directly to transcutaneous pacing  \nd. For shock that is sus pected to be from sepsis, norepinephrine is preferred  over dopamine \ndue to its reduced risk of arrhythmias and its lower mortality rate  \n7. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients   \n8. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight -based for non -obese \npatients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients   \n9. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, \nrecent research suggests that patients in  cardiog enic or septic shock treated with \nnorepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine   \n10.

Defibrillate or cardiovert  \nb. Acquire a 12 -lead EKG  \n2. Automatic non-invasive cuff blood pressures may be difficult to obtain due to the narrow pulse \npressure created by the continuous flow pump  \n3. Flow though many VAD devices is not pulsatile,  and patients may not have a palpable pulse or \naccurate pulse oximetry  \n4. The bloo d pressure, if measurable, may not be an accurate measure of perfusion  \n5. Ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or asystole/PEA may be the patient’s “normal” \nunderlying rhythm.

A-FIB rarely requires cardioversion in the field. As it is difficult to ascertain the onset of this \nrhythm, the risk of stroke needs to be considered prior to cardioversion  \n3. A wide -complex irregular rhythm should be considered pre -excited A-FIB; extreme care must be \ntaken in these patients  \na.

Avoid AV nodal b locking agents such as adenosine, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and \npossibly beta -blockers in patients with pre -excitation A-FIB (e.g. , Wolff -Parkinson -White \nSyndrome, Lown -Ganong -Levine Syndrome) because these drugs may cause a paradoxical \nincrease i n the ventricular response  \nc.

March  2022  \nAbuse and Maltreatment  55 \nVersion 3.0 \nAbuse and Maltreatment  \n \nAliases  \nMaltreatment of vulnerable populations  Non-accidental  trauma  \n \nDefinitions  \n1. Abuse/Maltreatment : Any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or \nperson in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or \nthreat of harm to a  patient of any age group.  EMS clinicians should have a heightened \nawareness for vulnerable populations which include, but is not limited to, children, elderly, \nand adults with mental or physical disabilities  \n2. Child Abuse/Maltreatment : Child maltreatment includes any act or series of acts of \ncommission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for \nharm, or threat of harm to a child. An act of commission (child abuse) is the physical, sexual,  \nor emotiona l maltreatment or neglect of a child or children. An act of omission (child neglect) \nincludes, but is not limited to, failure to provide for the child’s needs ( e.g.,  physical, emotional, \nmedical/dental, and educational neglect) and failure to supervise (e. g., inadequate supervision \nor safety precautions, lack of appropriate car seat use, and exposure to violent or dangerous  \nenvironments)  \n3. Human  Trafficking : when  people  are abducted  or coerced  into service  (e.g., being forced into \nservitude without compensation and/or prostitution) . Signs may include, but are not limited \nto, patient with branding/tattoos and environmental clues such as padlocks and/or doorknobs \nremoved on interior doors  and intact windows that are boarded  up \n \nPatient Care Goals  \n1. Recog nize any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a \nposition of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to \na patient  \n2. Take appropriate steps to protect the safety of the responder s as well as bystanders  \n3. Remove the patient from immediate danger  \n4. Assess any patient injuries that may be the result of acute or chronic events  \n5. Attempt to preserve evidence whenever possible; however, the overriding concern should be \nproviding appropriate e mergency care to the patient  \n6. Complete all mandatory reporting requirements per state guidelines  \n \nPatient  Presentation  \n1. Clues  to abuse  or maltreatment  can vary  with  age group  of the patient  and type  of abuse  \n2. Not all abuse or maltreatment is  physical  \n3. EMS role is  to: \na. Document  concerns  \nb. Assess potentially serious  injuries  \nc. Disclose concerns to appropriate  authorities  \nd. Initiate help to get the patient and any other vulnerable individuals at the scene into a safe  \nsituation  \ne. Not to investigate or intervene beyond t he steps  above  \nf.

Remove the patient to a safe place even if no medical indication for  transport  \n3. Report concerns about potential abuse/maltreatment to law enforcement immediately, in \naccordance with state law, including:  \na. Caregivers impeding your ability to assess/transport  patient  \nb. Caregivers refusing care for the  patient  \n4. For patients transported, report concerns to hospital and/or l aw enforcement personnel \n(including Child Protective Services agencies where appropriate) per mandatory reporting  laws  \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. If no medical emergency exists, the next priority is safe patient disposition/removal from the \npotentially  abusive  situation  \n2. Do not confront suspected perpetrators of abuse/maltreatment. This can create an unsafe \nsituation for EMS and for the  patient  \n3. In situations of parental or religious objections to life -saving medical care when EMS \nsuspects abuse, law enfo rcement should be notified for assistance  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. All states have specific mandatory reporting laws that dictate which specific crimes such as \nsuspected abuse or maltreatment must be reported and to whom they must be reported. It is \nimportant to be familiar with the specific laws in your state including specifically who must \nmake disclosures, what the thresholds are for disclosures, and to whom the disclosures must \nbe made  \n2. Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary depend ing on the age group of the patient and on \nthe nature of the abuse. Remember that not all abuse or maltreatment involves physical \nharm. EMS clinician s are often unique in being the only members of the medical team to \nobserve the home environment or injury scene . It is important to realize that the job of EMS is \nto document their concerns, assess the patient for potentially serious injuries, make sure that \ntheir concerns are disclosed to the appropriate legal authorities, and work towards getting the \npatient  into a safe situation. EMS personnel should not take it upon themselves to investigate, \ninterview, or intervene above and beyond those concepts and should leave further \nintervention to the appropriate law enforcement  personnel  \n3. Abuse and maltreatment can h appen to patients of all  ages  \n4. Patients may be unwilling or unable to disclose abuse or maltreatment,  so the responsibility \nfalls on EMS personnel to assess the situation, document appropriately, and take appropriate \naction to secure a safe place for the  patient  \n5. Document findings by describing what you see and not ascribing possible causes (e.g. , “0.5-\ninch round burn to back” as opposed to “burn consistent with cigarette  burn”)  \n \nPertinent Assessment Findings  \nAs noted above  \n \n \n \n"

These are complex and high -\nrisk encounters. There is no “one size fit s all” solution for addressing these patients  \n1. Don PPE  \n2. Do not attempt to enter or control a scene where physical violence or weapons are present  \n3. Dispatch law enforcement immediately to secure and maintain scene safety  \n4. Urgent de -escalation of patient agitat ion is imperative in the interest of patient safety as well as \nfor EMS personnel and others on scene  \n5. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled patient agitation and physical violence can place the patient \nat risk for sudden cardiopulmonary arrest due to the follo wing etiologies:  \na. Delirium with agitated behavior : A postmortem diagnosis of exclusion for sudden death \nthought to result from metabolic acidosis (most likely from lactate) stemming from physical \nagitation or physical control measures and potentially exacer bated by stimulant drugs ( e.g.,  \ncocaine) or alcohol withdrawal  \nb. Positional asphyxia : Sudden death from restriction of chest wall movement and/or \nobstruction of the airway secondary to restricted head or neck positioning resulting in \nhypercarbia and/or hypoxia  \n6. Apply a cardiac monitor as soon as possible, particularly when pharmacologic management \nmedications have been administered  \n7. All patients who have received pharmacologic management medications must be monitored \nclosely for the development of h ypoventilation and oversedation  \na. Utilize capnography if available  \n8. Patients who have received antipsychotic medication for pharmacologic management must be \nmonitored closely for the potential development of:  \na. Dystonic reactions (this can easily be treated wit h diphenhydramine/benzodiazepines)  \nb. Mydriasis (dilated pupils)  \nc. Ataxia  \nd. Cessation of perspiration  \ne. Dry mucous membranes  \nf. Cardiac arrhythmias (particularly QT prolongation)  \n9. Patients  who require physical management should  also receive pharmacological treatment  for \nagitation to prevent consequences of delirium with agitated behavior  \n10. Placement of stretcher in sitting position prevents aspiration and reduces the patient’s physical \nstrength by placing the abdominal muscles in the flexed position  \n11. Patients who are more physically uncooperative should be physically secured with one arm \nabove the head and the other arm below the waist, and both lower extremities individually \nsecured  \n \n \n"

No major co -morbid symptoms exist, like chest pain, shortness of breath, \nseizures,  intoxication  \nviii. A clear cause of the hypoglycemia is identified (e.g., missed  meal)  \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. Dextrose 10% can be safely used in all ages of  patient. Dextrose 10% works as effectively and \nquickly as other concentrations  \n2. Dextrose 50% can cause local tissue damage if it  extravasates from vein and  may cause \nhyperglycemia. Dextrose 50% carries risk for little clinical gain. EMS systems may consider \ncarrying  no more  than  25%  concentration  of dextrose  for treating  hypoglycemia  in adults  \n3. For children  less than  8 years old , dextrose  concentration  of no more  than  25%  should  be used  \n4. For neonates  and infants  less than  1 month  of age,  dextrose  concentration  of no more  than 10 –\n12.5% should be  used  \n5. Sulfonylureas ( e.g.,  glyburide, glipizide) have long half -lives ranging from 12 –60 hrs. Patients \nwith corrected hypoglycemia who are taking these agents are at particular risk for recurrent \nsymptoms and frequently require hospital  admission  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nA formula  for calculating a 0.5 g/kg dose of IV dextrose:  \n(____% concentration of glucose) x (_____mL/kg) = 50  \n \nFor example:  \nDesired  Fluid  type  mL of fluid Dose  \n0.5 g/kg  25% dextrose  2mL/kg  \n10% dextrose  5mL/kg  \n1 g/kg  25% dextrose  4mL/kg  \n10% dextrose  10mL/kg  \n \nKey Considerations  \n1. Using 10% dextrose is as effective and safer than other stronger concentrations  \n2. Consider contribution of oral diabetic medications to  hypoglycemia  \n3. If possible, have family/patient turn off insulin  pump  \n4. Consider potential for in tentional overdose of hypoglycemic  agents  \n5. Avoid overshoot hyperglycemia when correcting hypoglycemia. Administer dextrose -\ncontaining  IV fluids  in small  doses  until  either  mental  status  improves  or a maximum  field \ndose is  achieved  \n \n \n \n"

Pediatric : 1 mg/kg IV/IM/PO (maximum dose  50 mg) \n4. Medications  that prolong the QT interval may alter treatment options.   \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Ondansetron is preferred in children for the treatment of nausea and  vomiting  \n2. Metoclopramid e has fewer adverse effects than prochlorperazine in children  \n3. Prochlorperazine and metoclopramide (phenothiazines) have an increased risk of dystonic \nreactions  \na. Some phenothiazines also have an increased risk of respiratory depression when used \nwith  other  medications  that cause  respiratory  depression,  and some  phenothiazines  can \ncause neuroleptic malignant  syndrome  \nb. Prochlorperazine carries a black box warning for use in elderly patients with dementia -\nrelated psychosis.  \n4. IV form of ondansetron may be given PO in same  dose  \n5. Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of illness – in addition to treating the patient’s nausea and \nvomiting a thorough history and physical are key to identifying what may be a disease in need \nof emergent treatment ( e.g., bowel obstruction, myocardial infarction,  pregnancy)  \n6. While  ondansetron  has not been  adequately  studied  in pregnancy  to determine  safety, \nwomen should be counseled regarding the available data . In the first trimester of \npregnancy, the administration of metoclopramide 5 –10 mg IV with diphenhydramine 25 \nmg IV is recommended over the administration  of ondansetron  \n \n \n \n"

Use of non -invasive capnography is an earlier predictor of hypoventilation than pulse \noximetry if opioid medications are administered  \n8. Consider administration of oral, sublingual, or IV antiemetics to prevent nausea [ See \nNausea/Vomiting  Guideline ] \n9. If indicated based on pain assessment, and vital signs allow, repeat pain medication \nadministration (excluding acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory \nmedicines) after 5 minutes of the previous  dose  \n10. Transport in position of comfort and reassess as  indicated  \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. All patients  should  have  drug  allergies  identified  prior  to administration  of pain  medication  \n2. Administer opioids with caution to patients with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 15, \nhypotension, identified medication allergy, hypoxia (SPO 2 less than 90%) after maximal \nsupplemental oxygen therapy, or signs of  hypoventilation  \n3. Opioids are contraindicated for patients who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n(MAOI)  during  the previous  14 days  \n4. Avoid non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and ketorolac in patients \nwith NSAID allergy,  aspirin -sensitive  asthma,  renal  insufficiency,  pregnancy,  or known  peptic  \nulcer  disease  \n5. Ketorolac should not be used in patients with hypotension (due to renal toxicity)  \n6. Use of splinting techniques and application of ice should be done to reduce the total \namount of medication used to keep the patient comfortable  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Intranasal routes of opioid analgesia are preferred as the initial dosing route in \npediatrics where IV access may be problematic; consider in other patient \npopulations when an IV in not otherwise indicated  \n2. Onset of action is dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the drug class as well \nas route of a dministration; oral analgesics are effective for pain control but \n \n \n"

Trained personnel should be able to give medication without contacting medical direction , \nhowever, more than two doses of benzodiazepines are associated with high -risk of airway \ncompromise  \na. Use cauti on, weigh risks/benefits of deferring treatment until hospital, and/or consider \nconsultation with medical direction  if patient has received two doses of benzodiazepines by \nbystanders and/or prehospital clinician s \n2. Hypoglycemic patients who are treated in the field for seizure should be transported to hospital, \nregardless of whether  they return to baseline mental status after treatment  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Many airway/breathing issues in seizing patients can be managed without intubation or \nplacement of an advanced airway.  Reserve these measures for patients that fail less invasive \nmaneuvers as noted above  \n2. For children with convulsive status epilepticus requiring medication management in the \nprehospital setting, trained EMS personnel should be allowed to administer medication without \nmedical direction  \n3. For new onset seizures or seizur es that are refractory to treatment, consider other potential \ncauses including, but not limited to, trauma, stroke, electrolyte abnormality, toxic ingestion, \npregnancy with eclampsia, hyperthermia  \n4. A variety of safe and efficacious doses for benzodiazepines  have been noted in the literature for \nseizures  \na. The doses for anticonvulsant treatment noted above are those that are common to the forms \nand routes of benzodiazepines noted in this guideline  \nb. One dose, rather than a range, has been suggested to standardize  a common dose in \nsituations when an EMS agency may need to switch from one type of benzodiazepine to \nanother due to cost or resource limitations  \n5. Recent evidence supports the use of midazolam IM as an intervention that is at least as safe and \neffective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation  \n  \nPertinent Assessment Findings  \nThe presence of fever with seizure in children  less than 6 months old and  greater than  6 years \nold is not consistent with a simple febrile seizure, and should prompt evaluation for meningitis, \nencephalitis,  or other cause  \n \nQuality Improvement  \nAssociated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01)  (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) \n• 9914141 – Medical  - Seizure  \n \nKey Documentation Elements  \n• Actively seizing during transport and time of seizure onset/cessation  \n• Onset, focality, direction of eye deviation  \n• Concurrent symptoms of apnea, cyanosis, vomiting, bowel/bladder incontinence, or fever  \n• Medication amounts/routes given by bystanders or prehospital clinician s \n \n \n"

March  2022  \nShock  110 \nVersion 3.0 \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Early, aggressive IV fluid administration is essential in the treatment of suspected  septic s hock  \n2. Patients predis posed to  shock:  \na. Immunocompromised (patients undergoing chemotherapy or with a primary or \nacquired immunodeficiency)  \nb. Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, chronic or \nrecent steroid use)  \nc. History of a solid organ or bone marrow  transplant  \nd. Infants  \ne. Elderly  \n3. In most adults, tachycardia is the first sign of compensated shock, and may persist for hours. \nTachycardia can be a late sign of shock in children and a tachycardic child may be close to \ncardiovascular  collapse  \n4. Hypote nsion indicates uncompensated shock, which may progress to cardiopulmonary \nfailure within  minutes . Hypotension is a late and ominous sign in pediatric \nuncompensated shock  \n5. Hydrocortisone succinate, if available, is preferred over methylprednisolone and \ndexa methasone for the patient with adrenal insufficiency because of its dual glucocorticoid \nand mineralocorticoid  effects  \na. Patients with no reported history of adrenal axis dysfunction may have adrenal \nsuppression due to their acute illness, and hydrocortisone should be considered for any \npatient showing signs of treatment -resistant  shock  \nb. Patients with adrenal insufficiency may have an emergency dose of hydrocortisone \navailable that can be administered IV or  IM \n \nPertinent Assessment Findings  \n1. Decreased perfusion manifested by altered mental status, or abnormalities in capillary refill or \npulses, decreased urine output (1 mL/kg/ hr): \na. Cardiogenic,  hypovolemic,  obstructive  shock : capillary  refill  greater  than  2 seconds, \ndiminished peripheral pulses, mottled cool  extremities  \nb. Distributive shock : flash capillary refill, bounding peripheral  pulses  \n \nQuality Improvement  \nAssociated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01)  (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) \n• 9914127 – Medical  - Hypotension/Shock  (Non -Trauma)  \n \nKey Documentation Elements  \n• Medications  administered  \n• Full vital signs  (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment)  with \nreassessment q 15 minutes or more frequently as appropriate  \n• Lactate level (if  available)  \n• Neurologic status assessment [ See Appendix VII.

For adults and children with unwitnessed  cardiac arrest or for whom an AED is not \nimmediately availab le, it is reasonable that CPR be initiated while the defibrillator \nequipment is being retrieved and applied and that defibrillation, if indicated, be \nattempted as soon as the device is ready for use  \n2. The maximum setting on the defibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent \ndefibrillation attempts.  Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer’s recommendation in \nthe case of biphasic defibrillators.  If the manufacturer’s recommendation is unknown, use \nhighest setting possible.  In the case of  monophasic devices, the setting should be 360 J (joule ) \n(or 4 J/kg for children)  \n3. Chest compressions should resume immediately after defibrillation attempts with no pauses \nfor pulse checks for 2 minutes regardless of the rhythm displayed on the cardiac moni tor \n4. All attempts should be made to prevent avoidable interruptions in chest compressions, such \nas pre -charging the defibrillator and hovering over the chest, rather than stepping away \nduring defibrillations  \n5. If feasible, IV or IO access should be obtained. Administer epinephrine during the first or \nsecond round of compressions . Prioritize early administration of epinephrine for non -\nshockable rhythms  \n6. Continue the cycle of chest compressions for 2 minutes, followed by rhythm analysis and \ndefibrillation of shoc kable rhythms; during this period , the proper strategy of airway \nmanagement is currently not defined and many options for airway management exist . \nRegardless of the airway management and ventilation strategy, consider the following \nprinciples:  \na. The airway management strategy should not interrupt compressions  \nb. Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest depends primarily on effective, minimally \ninterrupted  chest compressions and prompt defibrillation  if the patient is in pulseless \nVT/VF . As opposed to children, an adult’s  airway management is of secondary importance \nand should not interfere with compressions and defibrillation . Options for airway \nmanagement include:  \ni. Passive ventilation:  \n1. High flow oxy gen is applied via a non -rebreather mask with an oropharyngeal \nairway  \n2. Some oxygen will be entrained with each decompression of the chest  \n3. This may be applied for the first 3 –4 compression cycles (6 –8 minutes), after \nwhich one may consider BVM ventilation or  placement of an advanced airway  \nii. BVM ventilation at 10 breaths per minute (1 breath every 10 compressions), applied \nduring the upstroke between compressions, without interrupting the compressions  \niii. BVM ventilation with 30:2 ventilation to compression ratio: Each 30 compressions, the \ncompressions are paused briefly to allow 2 BVM ventilations, then compressions \nimmediately resumed   \n1. Pediatric Consideration: For multiple rescuer CPR in children, 15:2 is the \nrecommended compression -to-ventilati on ratio (30:2 for single rescuer)  \n2.

Consider use of antiarrhythmic for recurrent VF/Pulseless VT  \na. The principal objective of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in shock -refractory VF and \npulseless VT is to facilitate the restoration and maintenance of a spontaneous perfusing \nrhythm in con cert with the shock termination of VF/VT; some antiarrhythmic drugs have \nbeen associated with increased rates of ROSC and hospital admission, but none have yet \nbeen proven to increase long -term survival or survival with good neurologic outcome  \ni. Amiodarone (5 mg/kg IV, max of 300 mg) may be considered for VF/pulseless VT that \nis unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy  \nii. Lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone for \nVF/pulseless VT that is unresponsive to CP R, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy  \niii. The routine use of magnesium for VF/pulseless VT is not recommended in adult \npatients  unless it is refractory, polymorphic VT, or Torsades de pointes . \nb.

Performing manual chest compressions in a moving vehicle may pose a clinician  safety \nconcern  \n2. In addition, manual chest compressions during patient movement are less effective in regard \nto hands on time, depth, recoil and rate  \n3. Ideally, patients should be resuscitated as close to the scene as operationally possible  \n4. Risks and benefits should be consi dered before patient movement in cardiac arrest situations  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Effective chest compressions and defibrillation are the most important therapies to the \npatient in cardiac arrest. Effective chest compressions are defined as:  \na. A rate of greater than 100 and less than 120 compressions/minute  \nb. Depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) and less than 2.4 inches (6  cm) for adults and children or \n1.5 inches (4 cm) for infants; adolescents who have entered puberty should receive the \nsame depth  of chest compressions as an adult  \nc. Allow for complete chest recoil (avoid leaning)  \nd. Minimize interruptions in compressions  \ne. Avoid rescuer fatigue by rotating rescuers at least  every 2 minutes.  Some EMS pit crew \napproaches use a clinician  on either side of th e chest, alternating compressions every \nminute or every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue  \n2. Avoid excessive ventilation and consider delayed airway management – If no advanced \nairway, consider:  \na. Passive ventilation using an NRB with 3 –4 cycles of uninterrupte d chest compressions (for \narrests of suspected cardiac etiology). Consider BVM ventilation or advanced airway after \n3–4 cycles  \nb. BVM ventilation every 10 –15 compressions with cycles of uninterrupted chest \ncompressions.  Upstroke ventilation between compressions.30:2 ventilation to \ncompression ratio for adults, and 15:2 for children when 2 rescuers are present  \nc. If an advanced airway is placed, ventilations should not exceed 10 breaths/minute (1 \nbreath every 6 seconds or 1 breath every 10 compressions) in adults.  Pediatric \nConsideration:  For children with an advanced airway, 1 breath every 3 –5 seconds is \nrecommended (equivalent to 12 –20 breaths/minute)  \n3. Quantitative end-tidal capnography ( EtCO 2) should be used to monitor effectiveness of chest \ncompression s \na. If EtCO 2 less than 10 mmHg during the initial phases of resuscitation, attempt to improve \nchest compression quality  \nb. Consider additional monitoring with biometric feedback which may improve compliance \nwith suggested Resuscitation Section   \n4. Chest compressions are usually the most rapidly applied therapy for the patient in cardiac \narrest an d should be initiated  as soon as the patient is noted to be pulseless.  If the patient is \nbeing monitored with pads in place at the time of arrest, immediate defibrillation should take \nprecedence over all other therapies . However, if there is any delay in defibrillation ( e.g., in \norder to place pads), chest compressions should be initiated while the defibrillator is being \napplied.  There is no guidance on how long these initial compressions should be applied; \nhowever, it is reasonable to either complete betw een 30 seconds and 2 minutes of chest \n \n \n"

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) for \npatients with cardiac arrest . In settings where it can be rapidly implemented, ECPR may be \nconsidered for select cardiac arrest patients for whom the suspected etiology of the cardiac \narrest is potentially rever sible during a limited period of mechanical cardiorespiratory support  \n6. Chest compressions should be reinitiated immediately after defibrillation as pulses, if present, \nare often difficult to detect and rhythm and pulse checks interrupt compressions  \n7. Continue  chest compressions between completion of AED analysis and AED charging  \n8. The e ffectiveness of chest compressions decreases when moving patients  \na. Patients should therefore be resuscitated as close to the point at which they are first \nencountered and should only be moved if the conditions on scene are unsafe or do not \noperationally allow for resuscitation  \nb. Chest compressions are also less effective in a moving vehicle  \nc. It is also dangerous to EMS clinician s, patients, pedestrians, and other motorists to \nperform chest compressions in a moving ambulance  \nd. For these reasons and because in most cases the care provided by EMS clinician s is \nequivalent to that provided in emergency departments, resuscitation should occur on \nscene  \n9. The maximum setting o n the defibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent \ndefibrillation attempts.  Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer’s recommendation in \nthe case of biphasic defibrillators.  If the manufacturer’s recommendation is unknown, use \nhighest se tting possible.  In the case of monophasic devices, the setting should be 360  J (joule ) \n(or 4 J/kg for children)  \n10. IV or IO access without interrupting chest compressions  \n11. Administer epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg, maximum dose 1 mg) IV/IO during the first or second \nround of compressions  \n12. At present, the most effective mechanism of airway management is uncertain due to some \nsystems managing the airway aggressively and others managing the airway with basic \nmeasures and both types of systems finding excellent outcomes.  Regardless of the airway \nmanagement style, consider the following principles:  \na. Airway management should not interrupt chest compressions  \nb. Carefully follow ventilation rate and prevent hyperventilation  \nc. Consider limited tidal volumes  \nd. There is uncertainty regarding the proper goals for oxygenation during resuscitation  \ni. Current recommendations suggest using the highest flow rate possible through NRB \nor BVM  \nii. This should not be continued into the post -resuscitation phase in which the goal \nshould be a n oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of 94 –98%  \ne. Pediatric Considerations : Special attention should be applied to the pediatric population \nand airway management/respiratory support.  Given that the most likely cause of cardiac \narrest is respiratory, airway management m ay be considered early in the patient’s care  \ni. However, the order of Circulation -Airway -Breathing is still recommended as the order \nof priority by the American Heart Association for pediatric resuscitation to ensure \ntimely initiation of chest compressions to  maintain perfusion, regardless of the \nunderlying cause of the arrest  \n \n \n"

In addition, conventional CPR is preferred in children, since it is associated with better \noutcomes when compared to compression -only CPR  \n13. Special Circumstances in Cardiac Arrest  \na. Trauma,  treat per the  General Trauma Management Guideline  \nb. Pregnancy  \ni. The best hope for fetal survival is maternal survival  \nii. Position the patient in the supine position with a second rescuer performing manual \nuterine displacement to the left to displace the gravid uterus and increase venous \nreturn by avoiding aorto -caval compression  \niii. If manual displacement is unsuccessful, the pa tient may be placed in the left lateral tilt \nposition at 30°. This position is less desirable than the manual uterine displacement as \nchest compressions are more difficult to perform in this position  \niv. Chest compressions should be performed slightly higher o n the sternum than in the \nnon-pregnant patient to account for elevation of the diaphragm and abdominal \ncontents in the obviously gravid patient  \nv. Defibrillation should be performed as in non -pregnant patients  \nc. Arrests of respiratory etiology (including drow ning) . In addition to the above, consider \nearly management of the patient’s airway. Passive ventilation with a NRB is not indicated \nfor these patients  \n14. Application of the “pit crew” model of resuscitation   \na. Ideally, clinician s in each EMS agency will use a “ pit crew” approach when using this \nprotocol to ensure the most effective and efficient cardiac arrest care. Training should \ninclude teamwork simulations integrating first responders, BLS, and ALS crewmembers \nwho regularly work together. High -performance sy stems should practice teamwork using \n“pit crew” techniques with predefined roles and crew resource management principles. \nFor example (the Pennsylvania State EMS Model for Pit Crew):   \ni. Rescuer 1 and 2 set up on opposite sides of patient’s chest and perform continuous \nchest compressions, alternating after every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue  \nii. Use a metronome or CPR feedback device to ensure that compression rate is 100 –\n120/minute  \niii. Chest compressions are only interrupted during rhythm check (AED analysis or \nmanual) and defibrillation shocks – Continue compressions when AED /defibrillator is \ncharging  \niv. Additional rescuer obtains IO (or IV) access and gives epinephrine . For IO access:  \n1. The proximal humerus is the preferred site for adults  \n2. The tibial site is preferred for infants and children  \nv. During the first four cycles of compressions/defibrillation (approximately 10 minutes) \navoid advanced airway placement  \nvi. One responding clinician  assumes code leader position overseeing the entire response  \nvii. Use a CPR checkli st to ensure that all best practices are followed during CPR  \nb. For efficient “pit crew” style care, the EMS agency medical director should establish the \noptions that will be used by clinician s functioning within the EMS agency.  Options include \nestablishing:  \ni. The airway/ventilation management, if any, that will be used  \nii. The initial route of vascular access  \n15.

The goal is \ntherefore to maximize survival and optimize neurologic and cardiovascular function following a return of \nspontaneous circulation by the following steps:  \nSecure airway   \nObtain vascular access   \nMaximize blood pressure   \nIdentify ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  or reversible causes of arrest   \nRecognize pending re -arrest   \nConsider appropriate destination choice   \n  \nPatient Presentation  \nInclusion Criteria  \nPatient returned to spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest resuscitation   \n  \nExclusion Criteria  \nNone noted   \n  \nPatient Management  \nAssessment, Treatment, and Interventions  \n1. Perform general patient  assessment  attempting  to identify cause of  cardiac  arrest .  \n2. Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation .  \na. For example, most of the  pediatric cardiac arrest occurs due to non -cardiac causes such as \nrespiratory failure (hypoxemia) or shock (hypovolemia).   \n3. Monitor closely for  recurrenc e of cardiac arrest  using clinical and adjunctive criteria such as \ncardiac monitoring, EtCO 2 monitoring, and physical signs of perfusion   \n4. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 –98% saturation. \nDo not hyperoxygenate.   \n5. Do not hyperventilate. Maintain a ventilation rate of 8 –10 breaths per minute, targeting an \nEtCO 2 of 35–45 mmHg.   \n6. For hypotension  (SBP less than 90 mmHg or MAP less than 65 in adults) see Shock  Guideline  \n7. Perform serial 12 -lead EKGs to assess for evidence of reversible cause of arrest such as STEMI \nor electrolyte derangement (e .g., hyperkalemia)   \n8. Post -cardiac arrest patients with evidence or interpretation consistent with ST elevation \nmyocardial infarction (STEMI/ acute MI) should be transported preferably to a facility capable \nof emergent cardiac catheterization or, as a secondary option, to a STEMI receiving facility \nbased upon local resources and system of care  \n9.

Consider  transporting  patients to an age -appropriate facility which offers specialized adult or \npediatric  post -resuscitation  care  \n  \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. Avoid  hyperthermia  (temperature  greater than  37.5 ° C or 99.5 ° F) by avoiding excessive \nenvironmental heat exposure, warm blankets, etc .  \na. Beyond interventions to prevent hyperthermia or fever, prehospital initiation of \ntherapeutic hypothermia (targeted temperature management) is not routinely \nrecommended   \n  \nNotes/Educational  Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Hyperventilation is a significant cause of hypotension and recurrence of cardiac arrest in the \npost resuscitation phase and must be avoided. Similarly, hypoventilation (suggested by an \nEtCO 2 greater than  40–45) contributes to worsening acidosis and may precipitate re -arrest  \n2. Most patients are comatose immediately after resuscitation and will require airway \nmanagement and ventilatory assistance  \n3. Many patients experience “stunning” of the cardiac muscle after ROSC. Hypotension is \ncommon, and volume resuscitation or vasopressor support is often required. Refer to the \n[Shock  Guideline ] for further recommendations  \n4. Common non -cardiac causes of post -resuscitation hypotension include hyperve ntilation, \nhypovolemia, and traumatic pneumothorax from chest compressions  \n5. The condition of post -resuscitation patients fluctuates rapidly and continuously requiring close \nmonitoring. A significant percentage of post -ROSC patients will re -arrest  \n6. Current re search has demonstrated that care of patients with ROSC at specialized centers is \nassociated with both decreased mortality and improved neurologic outcomes  \n7. Maintain mechanical CPR device in place in preparation for re -arrest  \n8. A moderate number of adult post -ROSC patients may have transient ST -elevation on EKG \nConsider performing serial EKGs.

When there is no response to prehospital cardiac arrest treatment, it is acceptable and often \npreferable to cease futile resuscitation efforts in the field  \n2. In patients with cardiac arrest, prehospital resuscitation is initiated with the goal of returning \nspontaneous circulation before permanent neurologic damage occurs. In most situations, ALS \nclinician s are capable of performing an initial resuscitation that  is equivalent to an in -hospital \nresuscitation attempt, and there is usually no additional benefit to emergency department \nresuscitation in most cases  \n3. CPR that is performed during patient packaging and transport is much less effective than CPR \ndone at the scene. Additionally, EMS clinicians  risk physical injury while attempting to perform \nCPR in a moving ambulance while unrestrained. In addition, continuing resuscitation in futile \ncases places other motorists and pedestrians at risk, increases the time that  EMS crews are \nnot available for another call, impedes emergency department care of other patients, and \nincurs unnecessary hospital charges. Lastly, return of spontaneous circulation is dependent on \na focused, timely resuscitation. The patient in arrest sh ould be treated as expeditiously as \npossible, including quality, uninterrupted CPR and timely defibrillation as indicated  \n4. When cardiac arrest resuscitation becomes futile, the patient’s family should become the \nfocus of the EMS clinician s. Families need to  be informed of what is being done and  that \ntransporting all cardiac arrest patients to the hospital is not supported by evidence .  This \npractice also  inconveniences the family by requiring a trip to the hospital where they must \nbegin grieving in an unfami liar setting. Most families understand the futility of the situation \nand are accepting of ceasing resuscitation efforts in the field  \n5.

Recent evidence has shown that , to capture over 99% of potential survivors from medical \ncardiac arrest (especially VF and pulseless VT arrests), resuscitation should be continued for \napproximately 40 minutes. This does not imply, however, that all resuscitations should \ncontinue this long ( e.g.,  asystolic rhythms)  \n2. In remote or wilderness situatio ns, EMS clinician s should make every effort to contact medical \ndirection , but resuscitation may be terminated in the field without  contacting  medical \ndirection  when the following have occurred :  \na. There has been no return of pulse despite greater than 30 minutes of CPR (this does not \napply in the case of hypothermia)  \nb. Transport to an emergency department will take greater than 30 minutes (this does not \napply in the case of hypothermia)  \nc. EMS clinician s are exhausted,  and it is physically impossible to continue the resuscitation  \n3. Logistical factors should be considered, such as collapse in a public place, family wishes, and \nsafety of the crew and public  \n4. Survival and functional neurologic outcomes are unlikely if ROSC is not obtained by EMS. It is \ndangerous to crew, pedestrians, and other motorists to attempt to resuscitate a patient \nduring ambulance transport  \n5.

Survival from traumatic cardiac arrest requires careful coordination between rapid prehospital \nassessment, EMS clinician treatment of reversible causes of traumatic cardiac arrest and \ntransport that is rapid, but also allows maintenance of necessary therap ies in a manner that is \neffective for patients as well as safe for EMS clinicians  \n2. Evidence for the benefit of CPR in traumatic cardiac arrest is limited. Treatment priorities \nshould initially focus on control of massive hemorrhage (including management  of pelvis \nfractures), airway management, and consideration of bilateral needle thoracostomy. I f CPR is \nperformed at all, it should be performed en route  to the hospital but only if it can be \nperformed in a safe and effective manner by EMS clinicians  \n3. Unless th ere is an immediate and correctable cause, patients suffering traumatic cardiac \narrest have the best chance for survival when arrival time to a hospital is within minutes  \n4. If transport is initiated, consider the ACS-COT’s Once the above treatments and inter ventions \nhave been performed, patients should be transported to the closest appropriate hospital \nwithin the defined trauma system  \n5. In an effort to reduce on -scene time, consider IV/IO access and initiation of resuscitation \nduring transport  \n6. Optimal choices f or resuscitation are (in descending order as available ) as follows : whole \nblood, balanced blood products (red blood cells ( RBC), plasma) , packed red blood cells alone, \nliquid,  or freeze -dried  plasma alone, no fluid resuscitation. Excessive crystalloid and colloid \nhave little to no value and may in fact be harmful in hemorrhagic shock  \n7.

If apneic or in significant respiratory distress:  \ni. Ventilate : BVM  ventilation with room air at 40 –60 breaths per minute  \n1. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with bag -mask device may be initiated with \nroom air (21% oxygen) in term and late preterm babies; otherwise use 100% \noxygen  \n2. Goal: SPO 2 at 10 minutes is 85 –95%  \nii. Consider endotracheal intubation per local guidelines  \n6. Evaluate : If heart rate less than 100 BPM  \na. Initiate BVM  ventilation with room air at 40 –60 breat hs per minute for 90 seconds with \nroom air  \ni. Primary indicator of effective ventilation is improvement in heart rate  \nii. Evaluate heart rate every 30 seconds  \niii. Rates and volumes of ventilation required can be variable, only use the minimum \nnecessary rate and volume to achieve chest rise and a change in heart rate; can control \nrate and volume by saying “squeeze, release” – squeeze the bag just until chest rise is \nindicated  then release to allow for exhalation  \nb. If no improvement after 90 seconds, change oxygen delivery to 30% FiO 2 (fraction of \ninspired oxygen) if blender available, otherwise 100% FiO 2 until heart rate normalizes  \nc. Consider endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway per local guidelines if BVM  \nventilation is ineffective  \n7. Resuscitate : If heart rate less than 60 BPM : \na.

Hypothermia is common in newborns and worsens ou tcomes of nearly all post -natal \ncomplications  \na. Ensure heat retention by drying the infant thoroughly, covering the head, and wrapping \nthe baby in dry cloth  \nb. When it does not encumber necessary assessment or required interventions, “kangaroo \ncare” (i.e. , placing the infant skin -to-skin directly against mother’s chest and wrapping \nthem together) is an effective warming technique  \nc. Newborn infants are prone to hypothermia which may lead to hypoglycemia, hypoxia , and \nlethargy. Aggressive warming techniques should be initiated including drying, swaddling, \nand warm blankets covering body and head. When available, radiant warmers or other \nwarming adjuncts are suggested for babies who require resuscitation, especially  for \npreterm babies. Check blood glucose and follow Hypoglycemia Guideline  as appropriate  \n2. During transport, neonate should be appropriately secured  (e.g., secured to mother with \napproved neonatal restraint system, c ar seat or isolette) and mother should be appropriately \nsecured  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Approximately 10% of newly born infants require some assistance to begin breathing at birth \nand 1% require resuscitation to support perfusion  \n2. Most newborns require only drying, warming , and stimulating to help the m transition from \nfetal respiration to newborn respiration.

Support the infant’s head as needed and apply gentle counterpressure to help prevent the \nhead from suddenly popping out  \n3. Check for nuchal cord (i.e., around the baby’s neck)  \na. If present, slip it over the head  \nb. If unable to free  the cord from the neck, double clamp the cord and cut between the \nclamps  \n4. Do not routinely suction the infant’s airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery  \n5. Grasping the head with hand over the ears, gently guide head down to allow delivery of the \nanterior shoulder  \n6. Gently guide the head up to allow delivery of the posterior shoulder  \n7. Slowly deliver the remainder of the infant  \n8. After 1 minute, clamp cord about 5 –6 inches from the abdomen with two clamps; cut the cord \nbetween the clamps  \na. If resuscitatio n is needed, the baby can still benefit from a 1 -minute delay in cord \nclamping . Start resuscitation immediately after birth and then clamp and cut the cord at 1 \nminute  \nb.

Record APGAR  scores at 1 and 5 \nminutes once neonate is stabilized  \n11. After delivery of infant, suctioning (including suctioning with a bulb syringe) should be \nreserved for infants who have obvious obstruction to the airway or require positive pressure \nventilation (follow  Neonatal Resuscitation Guideline  for further care of the infant) The  \nplacenta will deliver spontaneously, often within 5 –15 minutes after the infant is delivered  \na. Do not force the placenta to deliver; do not pull on the umbilical cord  \nb. Contain all tissue in plastic bag and transport  \n12.

NEVER pull on th e body, especially a preterm or previable baby – just support the \nbaby’s body while mother pushes when she feels the urge to  \nd. The presentation of an arm or leg through the vagina is an indication for immediate \ntransport to hospital  \ne. Nuchal  cord  \ni. After the he ad has been delivered, palpate the neck for a nuchal cord, if present, slip \nover the head  \nii. If the loop is too tight to slip over the head, attempt to slip the cord over the \nshoulders and deliver the body through the loop  \niii. The cord can be doubly clamped and c ut between the clamps; the newborn should be \ndelivered promptly  \nf. Excessive bleeding during active labor may occur with placenta previa or placental \nabruption  \ni. Obtain history from patient – known previa, recent pre -eclampsia symptoms, \nhypertension history, r ecent trauma, drug use especially cocaine  \nii. Placenta previa most likely will prevent delivery of infant vaginally  \niii. Place large bore IV and administer IV fluids as indicated  \niv. If available, transfusion or the administration of whole blood as indicated  \nv. C-Section most likely needed – transport emergently  \ng. Postpartum hemorrhage  \ni. Obtain history from patient – history of  prenatal or delivery complications, recent \ntrauma, prescription anticoagulants, drug use especially cocaine  \nii. Perform fundal massage  \n \n \n"

Suction airway:  for significantly contaminated airways, consider utilizing a suction assisted \nlaryngeal airway decontamination ( SALAD ) technique  \nc. Oropharyngeal airways (OPA) or nasopharyngeal airways (NPA) can be placed if needed to \nmaintain a patent airway and make BVM ventilation more effective  \ni. OPA  are used for patients without gag reflex  \nii. NPA are used for patients with gag reflex   \nd. Patient position ing can significantly impact respiratory mechanics . Patients with severe \nbronchospasm should be left in the position of comfort (perhaps tripod) whenever \npossible . Elevating the head or padding (shoulders, occiput) can assist with opening airway \nand respir atory mechanics . This can both improve the ability to ventilate and limit \naspiration  \ne. For patients with tracheostomy  in respiratory distress, see Tracheostomy Management \nGuideline  \n4. Use bag-valve -mask (BVM) ventilation  in the setting of respiratory failure or arrest . \nWhenever possible, the patient’s head should be elevated up to 30 degrees  \na. Two -person, two -thumbs -up BVM ventilation is preferred  \nb. PEEP  should be used with BVM  \ni. 5 cmH 20 is generally an appropriate i nitial PEEP setting  \nii. Increase PEEP in stepwise fashion (2 –3 cmH 20 at a time) as necessary, allowing \ntime for the patient to equilibrate with each change before further adjustments \nare made. The goal is to reach the lowest PEEP needed to adequately ventilate  \nthe patient. Higher PEEP results in greater negative hemodynamic impact . \nGenerally, physician consultation should be considered for higher PEEP levels \n(greater than 10 –15 cmH 20) \nc. Continuous wave -form capnography monitoring should be placed in line  \ni. In patie nts without primary pulmonary pathology ( i.e., acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome ( ARDS ), COPD), maintain EtCO 2 of no less than 35 and up to 40 \nmmHg . Patients with specific disease processes such as acute acid -base \ndisorders (i.e., DKA, lactic acidosis due to severe sepsis or trauma), acute \nrespiratory failure due to primary pulmonary pathology, or post -cardiac arrest \nwill have different EtCO 2 parameter s due to their underlying diseas e \nii. In patients with severe head injury with signs of herniation (unilateral dilated \npupil or decerebrate posturing), modest hyperventilation to EtCO 2 no less than \n30 mmHg may be considered for a brief time  \nd.

NIV can also be used to improve oxygenation pre -intubat ion in some patients with \nrespiratory failure  \n6. Supraglottic airways (SGA) : Consider the use  of an appropriately sized  SGA if BVM  (with \nOPA/NPA) alone is not effective in maintaining oxygenat ion and/or ventilation. This is \nespecially important in children as prehospital endotracheal intubation is an infrequently \nperformed skill in this age group and has not been shown to improve outcomes over \nprehospital BVM or SGA  \n7. Endotracheal intubation  \na. When less -invasive methods (two -person BVM, SGA placement) are ineffective or \ninappropriate, consider endotracheal intubation to maintain oxygenation and/or \nventilation . Other indications may include potential airway obstruction, severe inhalation \nburns, multiple traumatic injuries, altered mental status with loss  of normal protective \nairway reflexes  \nb. Optimize patient for first -pass success with pre -procedure resuscitation, preoxygenation, \npositioning, sedatives and paralytics as indicated by patient presentation   \ni. A bougie may be a helpful adjunct to successful airw ay placement, especially when \nvideo laryngoscopy is unavailable and the glottic opening is difficult to visualize with \ndirect laryngoscopy  \nii. For experienced EMS clinicians , video laryngoscopy may enhance intubation success \nrates and should be used when avail able  \nc. Monitor clinical signs, pulse oximetry, cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and waveform \ncapnography for the intubated patient  \nd. For adults, the largest tube size possible should be placed in the patient to limit difficulty \nwith mechanical ventilation and h igh airway pressures . Absent significant airway swelling \nor underlying anatomic abnormalities, initial tube size (internal diameter in millimeters) \nfor adult females should be 7.5, adult males 8.0 . For pediatrics, cuffed tubes are now \nrecommended  \n8. Post -intubation management  \na. Inflate endotracheal tube cuff with minimum air to seal airway. An ETT cuff \nmanometer can be used to measure and adjust the ETT cuff pressure to the \nrecommended 20 cmH 20 pressure  \nb.

Intubated patients should be provided appropriate sedation with sedative or opi oid \nmedications, and sedation titrated to an appropriate target level using RASS score \nor similar scale  \nh. Consider PEEP adjustment to achieve oxygenation and ventilation goals (see above)  \n9. Gastric decompression  can improve oxygenation and ventilation, so it s hould be \nstrongly considered in any patient with an advanced airway and positive pressure \nventilation  \n10. When patients cannot be oxygenated/ventilated effectively using the above \ninterventions, or when conventional airway approaches are impossible, surgical a irway \nmanagement is a reasonable option if the clinician  has competency in the procedure \nand risk of death for not escalating airway management seems to outweigh the risk of a \nprocedural complication  \n11. Transport to the closest appropriate hospital for airway  stabilization when respiratory \nfailure cannot be successfully managed in the prehospital setting  \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. Suctioning to limit aspiration is a priority, since it is associated with development of hospital \nacquired pneumonia and relate d increases in ICU stay and mortality.  \n2. Avoid excessive pressures or tidal volumes during BVM ventilation . The goal is to avoid \nbarotrauma as well as overventilation and related reduction of venous return /preload /cardiac \noutput.  \n3. Routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatment of anxiety in patients on NIV . \nAnxiety should be presumed due to hypoxia or inadequate minute ventilation and treated \nprimarily with ventilatory support.  \n4. Endotracheal intubation should only be used if less invasive  methods do not meet patient care \ngoals .  \n5. Once a successful SGA placement or intubation has been performed, obstruction or \ndisplacement of the tube can have further negative effects on patient outcome . Tubes should \nbe secured with either a commercial tube holder or tape.  \n6. Meticulous attention should be paid to avoiding hypoxia and hypotension during intubation \nattempts to limit patient morbidity and mortality.  \n7. Waveform capnography should be placed prior to the first breath through an invasive airway \nto confi rm placement.  \n8. Drug Assisted Airway Management (DAAM) should be reserved for specialized clinician s on \noperating within a comprehensive program with adequate resources, ongoing training and \nquality assurance measures, and close EMS physician oversight.  \n9. Once  initiated and patient is tolerating mask, DO NOT discontinue CPAP/BiPAP until patient is \non the emergency department stretcher and hospital CPAP /BiPAP  is immediately available for \npatient to be switched over, or physician is at bedside and requesting CPAP /BiPAP  be \ndiscontinued. Breaking the mask seal causes a significant decrease in airway pressures and \nmay lead to abrupt decompensation due to atelectasis and alveolar collapse.  \n10. If patient deteriorates on CPAP/BiPAP ( e.g., worsened mental status, increasing  EtCO 2, \nvomiting), remove CPAP/BiPAP and escalate airway management options as above.  \n11. If an endotracheal tube becomes dislodged, SGA should be strongly considered.  \n \n \n"

Pediatric airway management requires appropriately sized tools and adjuncts based on \npatient  size/age. A method for determining appropriate sizing should be available to all EMS \nclinicians.  \na. Skill in BVM ventilation and NIV application should be emphasized in pediatrics.  \nb. SGA are reasonable primary and secondary adjuncts if needed .  \nc. Pediatric endotracheal intubation has unclear benefit in the prehospital setting.  \nd. Pediatric endotracheal tube placement and maintenance requires significant training to \nachieve and maintain competency.  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Oxygen is  a drug with an appropriate dose range and undesirable effects from both too much \nand too little supplementation. Effective oxygenation meets the oxygen saturation (SpO 2) \ntarget set for that specific patient in the context of their acute and chronic medica l \ncondition(s) . Permissive hypoxia ( SPO 2 ≥ 90%) may be appropriate in patients with COPD or \nother complex respiratory pathology  \n2. Adequate ventilation provides sufficient minute ventilation to meet the patient’s acute \nrespiratory and metabolic needs and is g enerally titrated to an EtCO 2 goal \n3. Paramedics are less likely to attempt endotracheal intubation in children than adults with \ncardiac arrest and are more likely to be unsuccessful when intubating children . Complications \nsuch as malposition of the ET tube o r aspiration can be nearly three times as common in \nchildren as compared to adults  \n4. Continuous waveform capnography is an important adjunct in the monitoring of patients with \nrespiratory distress, respiratory failure, and those treated with positive pressur e ventilation. It \nshould be used as the standard to confirm placement of all advanced airways . It can also be \nhelpful in the respiratory distress patient without an invasive airway to assess for causes of \nrespiratory distress, adequacy of ventilation, prog ression toward respiratory failure, \nmonitoring of BVM ventilation, as well as numerous other applications that provide insight \ninto acute metabolic and infectious disease processes. Continuous waveform capnography:  \na. Should be used for patients with invasive airways for  \ni. initial verification of correct airway placement  \nii. continuous evidence of correct tube placement  \niii. to adjust ventilatory rate  \n1. to maintain EtCO 2 35–45 in most  patients  \n2. to appropriately but not excessively hyperventilate patients with signs of \nherniation only to maintain EtCO 2 30–35 (no lower than 30)  \n3. to gradually decrease EtCO 2 in chronically and acutely severely hypercarbic \npatients including post -arrest  \nb.

For apnea, provide 1 breath every 2–3 seconds adjusting  based on pulse \noximetry and digital capnometry or capnography (with the goal of 35 –45 mmHg)  \n6. PEEP improves oxygenation or decreases risk of developing hypoxemia, by increasing \nfunctional residual capacity (FRC), and tidal ventilation and may assist in meet ing airway goals \nby decreasing intrapulmonary shunting of blood and better matching perfused lung to \nventilated lung tissue, thus improving arterial oxygenation . It does not open fully collapsed \nalveoli but re -expands partially collapsed ones . It does not decrease extravascular lung water \nbut redistributes it  \na. Higher levels of PEEP are particularly useful in patients with acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome (ARDS)  \nb. PEEP should be increased slowly by 2 –3 cmH 20 from 5 cmH 20 to a max of 15 cmH 20 closely \nmonitoring response and vital sign changes  \nc. Excessive PEEP over distends  alveoli, increases dead space and work of breathing, reduces \nlung compliance, and compresses alveolar capillaries, reducing oxygenation and risking \npulmonary barotrauma  \nd. Increa sed intrathoracic pressure can progressively decrease cardiac output and is most \nnotable when PEEP is greater than 15 cmH 20.

March  2022  \nRespiratory Distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema)  193 \nVersion 3.0 \n3. Invasive airways do not improve bronchospasm . The airway should be managed in the  least \ninvasive way possible . Supraglottic devices and endotracheal intubation should be considered \nonly if BVM  ventilation fails  \n4. Positive pressure ventilation in the setting of bronchoconstriction, either via a supraglottic \nairway or intubation, increases the risk of air trapping which can lead to pneumothorax and \ncardiovascular collapse. These interventions should be reserved for situations of respiratory \nfailure  \n5. The following medications should not be administered to manage bronchosp asm as there is \nno evidence of patient benefit:  \ni. Inhaled magnesium sulfate  \nii. Heliox  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \n1. The combination of ipratropium with albuterol may decrease the need for hospital admission \nin certain patients  \n2. Magnesium sulfate may cause hypoten sion that will usually respond to a fluid bolus  \n3. Patient with acute heart failure and hypotension have high mortality  \n4. When assessing for cause of respiratory distress, CHF tends to be associated with lower levels \nof EtCO 2 compared to COPD . EtCO 2 values that are extremely low and high are markers of \npoor outcomes and need for intubation or ICU admission  \n \nKey Considerations  \n1. Nebulizer droplets can carry viral particles  and other airborne pathogens , so additional PPE \nshould be considered, including placement of a surgical mask over the nebulizer (if feasible) to \nlimit droplet spread  \n2. Factors that have been shown to be associated with increased mortality from asthma include:  \na. Severe asthma as evidenced by at least one of the following:  \ni. Prior near -fatal asthma  (e.g., ICU admission or intubation /mechanical ventilation ) \nii. Prior admissions for asthma or repeated ED visits, particularly if in the last year  \niii. Heavy use of beta -agonist  medications, or requiring three or more classes of asthma \nmedication  \nb. Together with one or more behavioral or psychosocial contributors:  \ni. Medication noncompliance  \nii. Alcohol or drug abuse  \niii. Obesity  \niv. Psychosis, depression, other psychiatric illness,  or major tran quilizer use  \nv. Employment or income difficulties  \nvi. Severe domestic, marital, or legal stressors  \n3. Single dose dexamethasone has been found equally effective as several days dosing of other \nsteroids, so dexamethasone is preferred over other po steroids  \n4. Acute hear t failure is a common cause of pulmonary edema – other causes include:  \na. Opioid overdose  \nb. High altitude exposure  \nc. Kidney failure or dialysis noncompliance  \nd. Lung damage caused by gases or severe infection  \n \n \n"

March  2022  \nRespiratory Distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema)  194 \nVersion 3.0 \n5. Nitroglycerin reduces left ventricular filling pressure p rimarily via venous dilation. At higher \ndoses the drug variably lowers systemic afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac \noutput  \n6. Pulmonary edema is more commonly a problem of volume distribution than total body fluid \noverload, so administration of diuretics such as furosemide provide no immediate benefit for \nmost patients and can cause significant harm . Inducement of inappropriate diuresis can lead \nto increased morbidity and mortality in patients with other disease processes such as \npneumonia and se psis \n7. Nitrates provide both subjective and objective improvement, and might decrease intubation \nrates, incidence of MIs, and mortality. High -dose nitrates can reduce both preload and \nafterload and potentially increase cardiac output and blood pressure  \n8. If av ailable  and trained , ultrasound is useful to distinguish pulmonary edema from other \ncauses of respiratory distress (including pneumothorax)  \n9. Pulmonary edema due to irritant gas inhalation (i.e., chlorine) generally is best managed by \nsupportive care and escalation of airway interventions as above once the patient is \nappropriately decontaminated . Early poison center consultation should be strongly considered \nfor guidance  \n10.

Severe respiratory distress may manifest with hypoxia, altered mentation, diaphoresis, or \ninability to speak more than 2 –3 words  \n2. In the setting of severe bronchoconstriction, wheezing may not be heard. Patients with known \nasthma with severe dyspnea should be empirically treated, even if wheezing is absent  \n3.

Set the heat moisture exchange (HME) at circuit Y.  \niii. Plateau pressure (PPlat) goal is less than  30 cmH 20 \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. Ventilators have different capabilities and features . Users must be familiar with the device they \nuse and must be properly educated on its use and application in the specific population being \ntreated  \n2. Ensure that all vent alarms are set appropriately,  and patient is continually monitored with pulse \noximetry and wave form capnography  \na. Set all alarms that involve high pressure, low pressure, minute volume, and apnea  \nb. Plateau pressure (PPlat) goal is less than  30 cmH 20 \nc. Set high pressure alarm 10 cmH2O above resting PIP  \nd. Set low pressure alarm 5 cmH2O below resting PIP  \ne. Set low minute volume alarm 25% below resting minute volume  \n3. During transport of a critically ill patient only necessary adjustments should be made to the \nventilator . Focus on maintaining adequate oxygenation, minute volume and patient comfort.  \n4. An increase in t he respiratory rate shortens the expiratory time. If changing rate, also check the I:E \nratio (the proportions of each breath cycle devoted to the inspiratory and expiratory phases ) and \nadjust the inspiratory time if necessary  \n5. The inspiratory time can be ad justed slightly to ensure greater patient comfort, however any \nchange in inspiratory time will affect the I:E ratio . Rarely should an inspiratory time be less than \n0.7 for an adult  \n6. Assure proper sedation level for patient to tolerate ventilator  \n7. Assure pati ent does not have auto -PEEP  \n8. Asthmatics and  patients with severe bronchoconstriction require different initial settings: for \nexample, PEEP  of 0, FiO 2 100%, tidal volume 5 mL/kg, rate 10, I:E of 1:4 – 1:6 to allow full \nexhalation and limit breath stacking /auto -PEEP . Hemodynamic instability may indicate increased \nintrathoracic pressure and require either manual chest wall compression to  promote full \nexhalation or possibly needle chest decompression for pneumothorax  \n \n \n \n"

Perform a pre -ventilator use inspection  including a circuit check on the ventilator prior to \nplacing it on a patient  \n2. Assess values during transport, including:  \na. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) Compare against baseline value to monitor for compliance \nchanges or obstruction in the circuit  \nb. Respirat ory rate . Compare with baseline value, rapid increases could indicate leaks. \nOverbreathing may require vent setting adjustment  \nc. Exhaled tidal volume . Compare against baseline, if extreme fluctuations, check for leaks in \ncircuit and in ET tube  \nd.

However, cuff should never be inflated if positive pressure \nventilation is not bei ng performed, or in patients with a Passy -Muir (teal colored) speaking \nvalve in place  \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. Especially in pediatric tracheostomy patients with significant respiratory distress, plugging or \ndislodgement of the tracheostomy is the problem until proven otherwise . Signs and symptoms \nof respiratory distress, cyanosis, ventilator alarms sounding, decreased level of consciousness, \ndecreased Sp O2 or cardiac arrest in patients with a trach eostomy , as well as bradycardia in \npediatric tracheostomy patients should be presumed due to a tracheostomy obstruction  \n2. Laryngectomy patients and some patients with congenital or surgi cal airway abnormalities \ncannot be orally intubated . Patients with tracheostomy alone ( e.g., for mechanical ventilation) \nand no airway abnormalities should be able to be orally intubated  \n3. For recent tracheostomy patients who present with bleeding from the tracheostomy in the \nearly (up to 3 weeks) postoperative period, a tracheoinnominate arterial bleed is an \nuncommon and life -threatening complication (0.7% incidence and a 90% mortality rate)  \na. 50% of these patients present initially with a smaller sentinel ble ed/hemoptysis which \nappears to have stopped  \nb. Inflation of the tracheostomy balloon to the maximum is a potential temporizing measure \nuntil definitive care can be provided, even overinflation may be needed . If the \ntracheostomy is uncuffed, it can be replaced  with a cuffed endotracheal tube and the \nballoon maximally inflated  \nc. Any patient in the early postoperative period (within a month of surgery) with hemoptysis \nor bleeding from a tracheostomy should be transported for evaluation, even if bleeding \nhas stopped  \n4. Prompt tracheostomy replacement is important . Delays allow for narrowing of the stoma and \ncan make recannulation more difficult  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Tracheostomy tube components  \na. Outer cannula: the tracheostomy size is stamped on the collar  \nb. Inner cannula: not found in all trach eostomie s \ni. Not commonly used in pediatric patients  \nii. Removed by gently twisting a quarter turn to the left and pulling out  \nc. Balloon cuff: protects lower airway from secretions /blood from above, allows for better \nmechanical ventilation  \nd. Collar: includes imprint of tube size and attachment for umbilical tape /tracheostomy ties \ne. Obturator: stiffens and provides shape to tracheostomy tube to facilitate insertion . Must \nbe removed for ventilation  \n2. To determine th e appropriate size suction catheter, double the size of the tracheostomy \n(number on collar of trach eostomy tube ) \n3.

If the patie nt is not in shock, the fluid rates recommended above will adequately maintain \npatient’s fluid volume.  \n4. Pain management is critical in acute burns.  \n5. End-tidal capnography ( EtCO 2) monitoring may be particularly useful to monitor respiratory \nstatus in patients  receiving significant doses of narcotic pain medication.  \n6. Cardiac monitor is important in electrical burns and chemical inhalations.  \n7.

A communication  barrier that prevents accurate assessment  \ni. If none of the above apply , patient may be managed without a cervical collar  \n2. Patients with penetrating injury to the neck should not be placed in a cervical collar or other \nspinal precautions regardless of whether  they are exhibiting neurologic symptoms or not. \nDoing so can lead to delayed identification of injury or airway compromise and has been \nassociated with increased mortality  \n3. If extrication is required:  \na. From a vehicle : After placing a cervical collar, if indicated, children in a booster seat and \nadults should be allowed to self -extricate. For infants and toddlers already strapped in a \ncar seat with a built -in harness, extricate the child while strapped in his/her car seat  \nb. Other situations requiring extrica tion: A, preferably padded, long board may be used for \nextrication, using the lift and slide (rather than a logroll) technique  \n4. Helmet removal  \na. If a football helmet needs to be removed, it is recommended to remove the face mask \nfollowed by manual removal (r ather than the use of automated devices) of the helmet \nwhile keeping the neck manually immobilized — occipital and shoulder padding should be \napplied, as needed, with the patient in a supine position to maintain neutral cervical spine \npositioning  \nb. Evidence is lacking to provide guidance about other types of helmet removal  \n5. Do not transport patients on rigid long boards unless the clinical situation warrants long board \nuse. An example of this may be facilit ation of immobilization of multiple extremity injuries or \nan unstable patient where removal of a board will delay transport and/or other treatment \npriorities. In these situations, long boards should ideally be padded or have a vacuum mattress \napplied to mi nimize secondary injury to the patient  \n6. Patients should be transported to the nearest appropriate facility, in accordance with the \nAmerican College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma ( ACS COT ) 2022 National Guideline for \nthe Fie ld Triage of Injured Patients   \n7. Patients with severe kyphosis or ankylosing spondylitis may not tolerate a cervical collar. \nThese patients should be immobilized in a position of comfort using towel rolls or sandbags  \n \nPatient Safety Considerations  \n1. Be aware of potential airway compromise or aspiration in immobilized patient with \nnausea/vomiting or with facial/oral bleeding  \n2. Excessively tight immobilization straps can limit chest excursion and cause hypoventilation  \n3. Prolonged immobilizati on on spine board can lead to ischemic pressure injuries to skin  \n4. Prolonged immobilization on spine board can be very uncomfortable for patient  \n5. Children are abdominal breathers  therefore immobilization straps should go across chest and \npelvis and not across  the abdomen   \n6. Children have disproportionately larger heads. When securing pediatric patients to a spine \nboard, the board should have a recess for the head or the body should be elevated \napproximately 1 –2 cm to accommodate the larger head size and avoid ne ck flexion when \nimmobilized  \n7. In an uncooperative patient, avoid interventions that may promote increased spinal \nmovement  \n8. The preferred position for all patients with spine management is flat and supine.

Suspected severe head trauma  \nc. Promotion of patient compliance  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Evidence is lacking to support or to refute the use of manual stabilization prior to spinal \nassessment in the setting of a possible traumatic injury when the patient is alert with \nspontaneous head/neck movement. Clinician s should not manually stabilize these alerts  and \nspontaneously moving pa tients since patients with pain will self -limit movement and forcing \nimmobilization in this scenario may unnecessarily increase discomfort and anxiety  \n2. Certain populations with musculoskeletal instability may be predisposed to cervical spine \ninjury. However , evidence does not support or refute that these patients should be treated \ndifferently than those who do not have these conditions. These patients should be treated \naccording to the Spinal Care Guideline  like other patients without these conditions  \n3. Pediatric considerations:  \na. Age alone should not be a factor in decision -making for prehospital spine care, yet the \npatient’s ability to reliably be assessed at the extremes of age should be considered. \nCommunic ation barriers with infants/toddlers or elderly patients with dementia may \nprevent the clinician  from accurately assessing the patient  \nb. There is no evidence that children experience non -contiguous multilevel injuries. The \nexisting evidence suggests that the  rate of contiguous multilevel injuries is exceedingly low \nat 1%  \nc. Because of variation in head size to body ratio, consider additional padding under the \nshoulders to avoid excessive cervical spine flexion  \n4. Spinal precautions  should be considered a tre atment or preventive therapy \n5. Patients who are likely to benefit from immobilization should undergo this treatment  \n6. Patients who are not likely to benefit from immobilization, who have a low likelihood of spinal \ninjury, should not be immobilized  \n7. Ambulatory patients may be safely immobilized on gurney with cervical collar and straps and \nwill not generally require a spine board . The role for standing take downs is extremely limited, \ne.g., extrication of a patient with a high likelihood of a spinal c ord injury from a large body of \nwater.

Another experienced EMS clinician should be assigned to immediate patient area and perform \nlife-saving interventions as well as continuous triage .  \n3. Prioritize patients within immediate group for transport.  \n4. If available, another EMS clinician should be assigned to delayed area and perform urgent \ninterventions if patient condition changes . Continu ously triage and prioritize within the \ndelayed patient group for transport.  \n5. Patient triage category may change with subsequent triage . If need for up -triage occurs, \nperform life -saving interventions,  and move patient to appropriate triage area (delayed or \nimmediate).  \n6. EMS system leaders within a defined area should work collaboratively to agree upon a \ncommon triage tool.  \n7. Evidence is limited on the highest performing triage tool. Available evidence suggests that the \nSALT triage tool was most likely to correc tly triage adult emergency department patients, but \nall tested triage tools demonstrated relatively high rates of under triage .  \n \nPertinent Assessment Findings  \nNone noted  \n \nQuality Improvement  \nAssociated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01)  (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) \nNone noted  \n \nKey Documentation Elements  \n• Document pertinent patient information per local EMS protocol when able and before \ntransport  \n \nPerformance Measures  \n• Rapidly triage,  treat and transport immediate life -threatening injuries  \n• Maintain scene safety for EMS clinicians and patients  \n \n \n"

Precautions for pralidoxime chloride administration : \na. Although Duodote ® and ATNAA ® contains atropine, the primary antidote for an \nacetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning, the inclusion of pralidoxime chloride  in \nthe auto -injector can present challenges if additional doses of atropine are warranted \nby the patient condition and othe r formulations of atropine are unavailable : \ni. Pediatrics : an overdose of pralidoxime chloride may cause profound \nneuromuscular weakness and subsequent respiratory depression  \nii. Adults : Especially for the geriatric victim, excessive doses of pralidoxime \nchloride may cause severe systolic and diastolic hypertension, neuromuscular \nweakness, headache, tachycardia, and visual impairment  \niii. Geriatrics : victim who may have underlying medical conditions, particularly \nimpaired kidney function or hyperten sion, the EMS clinician  should consider \nadministering the lower recommended adult dose of intravenous pralidoxime \nchloride  \n5. Considerations during the use of auto -injectors  \na. If an auto -injector is administered, a dose calculation prior to administration is \nnot necessary  \nb. For atropine, additional auto -injectors should be administered until secretions diminish.  \nc. Mark  1 kits, Duodote ® and ATNAA ® have not been approved for pediatric use by the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA), but they can be considered for the initial treatment for \nchildren of any age with severe symptoms of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent \npoisoning especially if other f ormulations of atropine are unavailable  \nd. Pediatric Atro -Pen® auto -injectors are commercially available in a 0.25 mg auto -\ninjector ( yellow ) and a 0.5 mg auto -injector ( red). Atro -Pen® auto -injectors are \ncommercially available in a 1 mg auto -injector ( blue ) and a 2 mg auto -injector ( green ) \ne. A pralidoxime chloride 600 mg auto -injector may be administered to an infant \nthat weighs greater than 12 kg  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Consideration s \n1. Clinical effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibito r agents  \na. The clinical effects are caused by the inhibition of the enzyme \nacetylcholinesterase which allows excess acetylcholine to accumulate in the \nnervous  system  \nb. The excess  accumulated  acetylcholine  causes  hyperactivity  in muscles,  glands,  \nand nerves  \n2. Organophosphates Insecticides  \na. Can be legally purchased by the general publi c \nb. Organophosphate pesticides penetrate tissues and bind to the patient's body fat \nproducing a prolonged period of illness and ongoing toxicity even during aggressive \ntreatmen t \n3. Nerve  agents  \na. Traditionally classified as weapons of mass destruction (WMD ) \nb. Not readily accessible to the general publi c \nc. Extremely toxic and rapidly fatal with any route of exposur e \nd. GA (tabun), GB (sarin), GD (soman), GF, and VX are types of nerve agents and are WMD s \n \n \n"

Contamination : Poisoning from direct exposure to a radioactive source, \ncontaminated debris, liquids, or clothing where radiation continues to be emitted \nfrom particles on surface  \nd. Exposure : Poisoning from radioactivity, in the form of ionizing rays, \npenetrating through t he bodily tissues of the patien t \n5. Common types of radioactivity that cause poisonin g \ne. Gamma  rays \ni. Highest frequency of ionizing  rays \nii. Penetrates the skin deepl y \niii. Causes the most severe radiation  toxicity  \nf. Beta rays : can penetrate up to 1 cm of the skin's thicknes s \ng. Alpha ray s \ni. Lowest frequency of ionizing  rays \nii. Short range of absorptio n \niii. Dangerous only if ingested or  inhaled  \nh. Radioactive  daughters  \ni. Products of decay of the original radioactive substan ce \nii. Can produce gamma and beta rays ( i.e., uranium decays into a series of radon \ndaughters ) \n6. In general, trauma patients who have been exposed to or contaminated by radiation \nshould be triaged and treated based on  the severity of their conventional injurie s \n7.

Apply a cardiac monitor for oral or large dermal exposures significant HF  exposures  \nc. Apply calcium  preparation:  \ni. Calcium prevents tissue damage from hydrofluoric  acid  \nii. Topical calcium  preparations:  \n1. Commercially manufactured calcium gluconate gel  \n2. If commercially manufactured calcium gluconate gel is not available, a \ntopical calcium gluconate gel preparation can be made by combining 150 mL \n(5 ounces) of a sterile water -soluble gel (e.g., Surgilube® or KY ® jelly) with \none of the following:  \na. 35 mL of calc ium gluconate 10%  solution  \nb. 10 g of calcium gluconate tablets  (e.g.,  Tums ®) \nc. 3.5 g calcium gluconate powder  or \n3. If calcium gluconate is not available, 10 mL of calcium chloride 10% \nsolution in 150 mL in sterile water -soluble  gel (e.g.,  Surgilube® or KY ® jelly)  \n4. Apply generous amounts of the calcium gluconate gel to the exposed skin \nsites to neutralize the pain of the hydrofluoric acid  \n \n \n"

Leave in place for at least 20 minutes then  reassess  \nb. This can be repeated as  needed  \n5. Hydrofluoric acid exposure is very painful. Calcium gel is the foundation of \npain control. While intravenous pain medications may be less effective, they \nshould be added to calcium gel to assist with pain control . Hydrofluoric acid \nexposure typically causes pain out of proportion to the vis ible dermal effects. \nMinimal skin changes may exist with substantial exposures  \n6. If fingers are involved, apply the calcium gel to the hand, squirt additional \ncalcium gel into a surgical glove, and then insert the affected hand into the \nglove  \n7. For patients wh o have ingested hydrofluoric acid or who have a large dermal \nexposure consider intravenous calcium gluconate, 1 –2 grams  of 10% \nsolution, as symptomatic hypocalcemia can precipitate rapidly as manifest \nby muscle spasms, seizures, hypotension ventricular arr hythmias , and QT \nprolongation  \n \nPatient Safety Consideration s \n1. Don PPE  \n2. Take measures to prevent the patient from further contamination through decontamination  \n3. Take measures to protect the EMS clinician  and others from contamination  \n4. Do not attempt to neutrali ze an acid with an alkali or an alkali with an acid as an exothermic \nreaction will occur and cause serious thermal injury to the patient  \n5. Expeditious transport or transfer to a designated burn center should be considered for burns \nthat involve a significant  percentage of total body surface area or burns that involve the eyes, \nface, hands, feet , or genitals  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearl s \nKey Consideration s \n1. IV fluid resuscitation should be guided by patient age, percentage of body surface area \ninvolved in burn, body habitus and calculated by the Parkland Formula [ See Appendix  \nVI. Burn and Burn Fluid Charts ] \n2. Since the severity of topical chemical burns is largely dependent upon the type, \nconcentration, and pH of the chemical involved as well as the body site and surface area \ninvolved, it is imperative to obtain as much information as possible while on scene about \nthe chemical substance by which the patient was exposed. The information gathering \nprocess will often include:  \na. Tran sport of the sealed  container of the chemical to the receiving facilit y \nb. Transport of the original or a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of \nthe substance to the receiving facility  \nc. Contacting the reference agency to identify the chemical agent and assist \nin management ( e.g.,  CHEMTREC ®) \n3. Inhalation of HF should be considered in any dermal exposure involving the face and neck \nor if clothing is soaked in the  product  \n4. Decontamination is critical for both acid and alkali agents to reduce injury — removal of \nchemicals with a low pH (acids) is more easily accomplished than chemicals with a high \npH (alkalis) because alkalis tend to penetrate and bind to deeper tissues  \n5. Some ch emicals will also manifest local and systemic signs, symptoms, and bodily  damage  \n \n \n"

Consider treating shortness of breath as atypical ACS  \na. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 –98% saturation  \n5. Consider soft physical management devices especially if law enforcement has been \ninvolved in getting patient to cooperate [ See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral \nEmergency Guideline  ] \n6. Consider medications to reduce agitation and other significant sympathomimetic findings , \npreferably benzodiazepines, for  the safety of the patients and clinician s.

Recognition and treatment of hyperthermia (including sedatives to decrease \nheat production from muscular activity) is essential as many deaths are \nattributable to hyperthermia  \n2. If law enforcement has placed the patient in handcuffs, this patient needs ongoing \nphysical security for safe transport. Have law enforcement in back of ambulance for the \nhandcuffed patient or make sure proper non -handcuff physical management devices are \nin place before law enforcement leaves and ambulance departs from scene  \n3. If patient has signs and symptoms of ACS, consider giving nitroglycerin sublingual  (SL) \nq (quaque, every) 3–5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg and until pain resolves \n(if range not desired, use q 3 minutes ) \na. Vasospasm is often the problem in this case as opposed to a fixed coronary artery lesion  \nb. Consider administration of benzodiazep ines as if to treat anxiety  \n4. Maintaining IV access, cardiac monitor, and SPO 2/EtCO 2 monitors are key to being able \nto catch and intervene decompensations in a timely  manner  \na. If agitated, consider restraining the patient to facilitate patient assessment and \nlessen likelihood of vascular access or monitor displacements  \n5. Cocaine has sodium channel blocking effects and can cause significant cardiac \nconduction abnormalities with a widened QRS. Treatment is with sodium bicarbonate \nsimilar to a tricyclic antidepressant. Check a 12 -lead EKG to assess for these \ncomplications  \n \nPertinent Assessment Findings  \n1. History is as important as the physical examination.  \n2. If the patient is on psychiatric medication, but has failed to be compliant, this fact alone puts \nthe patient at higher risk for the adverse outcome of delirium with agitated behavior  \n3. If the patient is found naked, this may elevate the suspicion for stimulant use or abuse . These \nsubstances  increase the risk for sudden death secondary to delirium with agitated behavior . \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome  or serotonin syndrome can present with similar signs and \nsymptoms  \n4. If polypharmacy is suspected, hypertension and tachycardia are expected hemodynamic \nfindings secondary to increased dopamine release. Stimul us reduction from benzodiazepines, \nanti-psychotics, and ketamine will improve patient's vital signs and behavior  \n5.

If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agent \nwithout adequately protecting the airway  \n2. Check blood glucose level on all patients but especially on pediatric patients as beta -\nblockers  can cause hypoglycemia in pediatric population  \n3. Consider atropine sulfate for symptomatic bradycardia  \na. Adult : Atropine 1 mg IV  q 5 minutes to  maximum of 3 mg  \nb. Pediatric : Atropine 0 .02 mg/kg (0 .5 mg maximum) q 5 minutes, maximum total dose \n1 mg  \n4. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension with associated bradycardia  \n5. For symptomatic patients with cardiac effects ( e.g., hypotension, bradycardia) consider:  \na. Adult : Glucagon initial dose 5 mg IVP — this can be repeated in 5 –10 minutes for a \ntotal of 10 mg  \nb. Pediatric : \ni. Glucagon 1 mg IVP (25 –40 kg) every  5 minutes as necessary  \nii.

A signific ant reduction in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs occurs \nwith carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide is also a cellular toxin which can result in delayed or \npersistent neurologic sequelae in significant exposures. With any form of combustion (fire /smoke [e.g., \npropane, kerosene, or charcoal stoves or heaters], combustion engines [e.g., generators, lawn mowers, \nmotor vehicles, home heating systems]), carbon monoxide will be generated. People in a fire may also be \nexposed to cyanide from the combusti on of some synthetic materials.

High -potency opioids [ See Key Considerations ] may require higher and/or more \nfrequently administered doses of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression and/or to \nmaintain adequate respirations  \n6. Regardless of the doses of naloxone adm inistered, airway management with provision \nof adequate oxygenation and ventilation is the primary goal in patients with confirmed \nor suspected opioid overdose  \n \nPatient Safety Consideration s \n1. Clinical duration of naloxone  \na. The clinical opioid reversal effect  of naloxone is limited and may end within an hour \nwhereas opioids often have a duration of 4 hours or longer  \nb. Monitor the patient for recurrent respiratory depression and decreased mental status  \n2. Opioid withdrawal  \na. Patients with altered mental status seconda ry to an opioid overdose may become agitated \nor violent following naloxone administration due to opioid withdrawal therefore the goal \nis to use the lowest dose as possible to avoid precipitating withdrawal  \nb. Be prepared for this potential scenario and take t he appropriate measures in advance to \nensure and maintain scene safety  \n3.

Overuse and abuse of prescribed and illegal opioids has led to an increase in accidental \nand intentional opioid overdoses  \n4. Opioid combinations:  \na. Some opioids are manufact ured as a combination of analgesics with acetaminophen, \nacetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), or other substances  \nb. In the scenario of an overdose, there is a potential for multiple drug toxicities  \nc. Examples of opioid combination analgesics:  \ni. Vicodin ® is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone  \nii. Percocet ® is a combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone  \niii. Percodan ® is a combination of aspirin and oxycodone  \niv.

March  2022  \nAirway Respiratory Irritants  314 \nVersion 3.0 \nMedication Administration  \n1. If wheezing is present, consider administering inhaled albuterol (2.5–5 mg) as nebulized, or \nfour to eight puffs metered dose inhaler  \n2. lpratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given in conjunction with albuterol, up to three doses  \n \nPatient Safety Consideration s \n1. Generally, speaking to patients with exposure to highly soluble airway/respiratory irritants you \nwill find that they have s elf-extricated due to the warning properties such as the smell, \nrapidity of onset of irritation, and other symptoms  \n2. The less soluble agents may generate only an odor ( e.g., mowed hay smell for Phosgene) and \nwill have delayed serious symptoms such as acute pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and shortness \nof breath with minimal exertion  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearl s \nKey Consideration s \n1. Airway respiratory irritants can exacerbate underlying reactive airway diseases (e.g., \nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ) and precipitate or exacerbate \nbronchospasm, respiratory distress, and hypoxia  \n2. As patients may be off gassing  (particularly hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide) in the \nback of the transport vehicle, it is important to have adequate ventilation of the pa tient \ncompartment  \n3. Removal from the toxic environment, oxygen (humidified if available), general supportive \ntherapy, bronchodilators, respiratory support, and rapid transport are core elements of \ncare as there are no specific antidotes for any of these inha led agents except for  heavy \nmetals that may be chelated in -hospital after agent identification  \n4. Hydrogen sulfide causes the cells responsible for the sense of smell to be stunned into \ninaction and therefore with a very short exposure will shut down and the exposed victim \nwill not perceive the smell, yet the victim continues to absorb the gas as it is still present  \n5. Inhaled agents have become popular as a means of committing suicide. If there is some \nform of suicide signage, hoses, or buckets of substances  visible as you arrive at the \nvehicle or residence, immediately retreat to well ventilated area and don self-contained \nbreathing apparatus ( SCBA ) before opening the vehicle or making entry as these gases \nmay be highly concentrated and potentially lethal to  EMS responders  \n6. Househ old bathroom, kitchen, and oven cleaners when mixed can generate various  \nairway respiratory irritants (ammonia, chloramine, and chlorine gas releases are \nparticularly common). A very common exposure is to chloramine, a gas liberated w hen \nbleach (hypochlorite) and ammonia are combined. Chloramine then hydrolyzes in the \ndistal airways and alveoli to ammonia and hypochlorous acid  \n7. Sudden sniffing death can result from a single use of inhalant of abuse  \na. Some inhalants can cause cardiac arres t due to dysrhythmias from irritated \nmyocardium  \nb. This syndrome most often is associated with abuse of butane, propane,  and effects \nof the chemicals in the aerosols  \n \nPertinent Assessment Findings  \n1.

For patients with signs and symptoms of heat stroke, rapid cooling takes priority over \nother interventions (e.g., cardiac monitoring, IV access)  \n6. Do not forget to look for other causes of altered mental status such as low blood glucose \nlevel, or, in the proper circumstances ( i.e., endurance exercise events), consider exercise \nassociated hyponatremia (EAH), especially in the patient with altered mental status, \nnormal blood glucose, and normal temperature  \n7.

Given the additive effects of additional cold stress, the patient should be removed from the \ncold environment as soon as operationally feasible  \n2. In patients suffering from moderate to severe hypothermia, it is critical to not allow these \npatients to stand  or exercise as this may cause circulatory collapse  \n3. Devices that self -generate heat ( e.g., heat packs) that are being utilized during the rewarming \nprocess should be wrapped in a barrier to avoid direct contact with the skin and to prevent \nburns. Available evidence suggests that heat packs with peak temperatures above 45°C \n(113°F) are most like ly to cause burns. In patients who are unresponsive, or unable to \nrecognize a developing injury, please check the area in which the heating pad is placed \nregularly to ensure no tissue damage occurs.  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearl s \nKey Consideration s \nConsideratio ns in cardiac arrest  \n1.

The temperature at which defibrillation should first be attempted in the severely \nhypothermic cardiac arrest victim and the number of defibrillation attempts is unclear. \nThere are different approaches regarding res uscitation of the hypothermic arrest \npatient  \na. Per the American Heart Association (AHA), if the patient has a shockable rhythm \n(VF/VT), defibrillation should be attempted . It is reasonable to continue defibrillation \nattempts per AHA protocols concurrently with rewarming strategies  \nb. The state of Alaska's 2014 guidance on management of hypothermic patients in \ncardiac arrest advises that defibrillation should be attempted once,  followed by 2 \nminutes of chest compressions, then rhythm and pulse checks  \ni. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core temperature is less than  \n30°C (86°F), do not make further attempts at defibrillation until the core \ntemperature has increase d to greater than 30°C (86°F ) \nii. Continue CPR and attempt to rewarm the patient  \nc. An alternate strategy, per the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia \nguideline, suggests that if the patient's core temperature is below 30°C (86°F), \nattempt defibri llation once, then wait until the patient has been rewarmed at least \n1°–2°C or to 30°C (86°F) before attempting additional shocks. It is noted that the \nlikelihood of successful defibrillation increases with every one -degree increase in \ntemperat ure \nd. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core temperature is greater than \n30°C (86°F), follow guidelines for normothermic patients  \ne. If available monitors reveal asystole, CPR alone is the mainstay of therapy  \nf. If monitoring reveals an organized rhythm  (other than VF or VT) and no pulses \nare detected, do not start CPR, but continue to monitor  \ni. While this may represent pulseless electrical activity (PEA), this may also \nrepresent situations in which the patient's pulses are not detectable but remain \neffect ive due to decreased metabolic needs  \nii. In the case of PEA, the rhythm will deteriorate rapidly to asystole, in which case,  CPR \nshould be initiated  \niii. Given the potential to cause VF with chest compressions, the Alaska guidance \noffers that it is better to mainta in effective cardiac activity than to start CPR and \ncause VF  \n5. Manage the airway per standard care in cardiac arrest victims [ See Cardiac Arrest Guideline ] \na. In the absence of advanced airways, ventilate the patient at the same rate as \na normothermic patien t \nb. If the patient has an advanced airway, ventilate at half the rate recommended for \na normothermic patient to prevent hyperventilation. If EtCO 2 is available, ventilate \nto maintain normal EtCO 2 levels  \n6. There is little evidence to guide use of medications in severe hypothermia with  cardiac \narrest, however 2010 AHA updates to advanced cardiac life support recommend use of \nvasopressors according to standard ACLS protocols while the 2014 Alaska guide lines and \nthe Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline for the management of \nhypothermic patients advises medications should be withheld until the patient's core \ntemperature is greater than 30°C (86°F ) \na.

The World Health Organization definition of drowning is \" the process of \nexperiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid \" \n2. Drowning is further defined in the following categories : \na. Non-fatal drowning : patients rescued from drownin g \nb. Fatal drowning : any death, acutely or subacutely, resulting  from drownin g \n3. Submersion refers to situations in which the patient's airway is underwater. Immersion \nrefers to situations in which the patient's body is in water,  but the patient's airway \nremains out of the wat er \n4. Pediatric Consideration s: \na. Drowning is a common cause of death in  children  \nb. Risk factors for drowning include male gender, age less than 14 years old , alcohol \nuse, lack of supervision, and risky behavior  \n5. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure patient \nis rapidly accessed and removed from the  water  \n6. Initiation of in -water ventilations may increase survival . In-water chest compressions are \nfutile \n7. The European Resuscitati on Council recommends five initial breaths be provided to \nthe drowning  victim  \na.

Rapid descent by a minimum of 500 –1000 feet is a priority, however rapidity of \ndescent must be balanced by current environmental conditions and other safety \nconsiderations  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Patients suff ering from altitude illness have exposed themselves to a dangerous \nenvironment. By entering the same environment, clinician s are exposing themselves to \nthe same altitude exposure. Be vigilant in looking for symptoms of altitude illness \namongst rescuers  \n2. Descent of 500 –1000 feet is often enough to see improvements in patient conditions  \n3. Patients with HAPE are suffering from non -cardiogenic pulmonary edema and may \nbenefit from positive pressure ventilation via either bag assisted ventilation, CPAP, or \nother mea ns of positive pressure ventilation  \n4. Patients suffering from altitude illness are commonly dehydrated and require IV fluids — \nonce resuscitation is complete and the patient requires no further fluid boluses, maintain \nIV fluids at 125 mL/hr \n5. HAPE is the most lethal of all altitude illnesse s \n6. Consider alternate causes of symptoms of AMS — the symptoms of AMS may be caused \nby alterna te etiologies such as carbon monoxide poisoning (in patients cooking within \nenclosed areas), dehydration, exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia  \n7.  Children with the following are at greater risk for altitude illness:  \na. Those with a concurrent upper or lower r espiratory tract infection or otitis media.  \nb. Full term infants less than 6 weeks of age, or preterm infants less than 46 weeks post \nconceptual  age \nc. Congenital heart disease  \nd. Down syndrome, especially those with obstructive sleep apnea  \ne.

Follow local protocols, including  those of \nlaw enforcement for evidence collection and retention.  \n3. Treat medical and traumatic injury  \n \nPatient Safety Consideration s \n1. Before removal of the barbed dart, make sure the cartridge has been removed from the \nconducted electrical weapon  \n2. Patient shou ld not be restrained in the prone, face down, or hog -tied position as respiratory \ncompromise is a significant risk  \n3. The patient may have underlying pathology before being tased (refer to appropriate \nguidelines for managing the underlying medical/traumatic p athology)  \n4. Perform a comprehensive assessment with special attention looking for signs and symptoms \nof active medical decompensation  \n5. Transport the patient to the hospital  \n6. EMS clinician s who respond for a conducted electrical weapon patient should not perform a \n\"medical clearance\" for law enforcement to then take the patient to a nonmedical facility  \n \nNotes/Educational Pearls  \nKey Considerations  \n1. Conducted electrical weapon can be discharged in three fashions:  \na. Direct contact without the use of the darts  \nb. A single dart with addition contact by direct contact of weapon  \nc. From a distance up to 35 feet with two darts  \n2. The device delivers 19 pulses per second with an average current per pulse of 2 .1 \nmilliamps which, in combination with toxins/drugs, patient 's under lying diseases, \nexcessive physical exertion, and trauma, may precipitate arrhythmias. Thus, consider \ncardiac monitoring and 12 -lead EKG assessment  \n3. Drive Stun is a direct weapon two -point contact which is designed to generate pain and \nnot incapacitate the s ubject. Only local muscle groups are stimulated with the Drive Stun \ntechniq ue \n \nPertinent Assessment Findings  \n1. Thoroughly assess the patient for trauma as the patient may have fallen from standing or \nhigher  \n2. Ascertain if more than one TASER ® cartridge was used (by one or more officers, in effort \nto identify total number of possible darts and contacts)  \n \nQuality Improvemen t \nAssociated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01)  (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) \n• 9914203  – Injury  - Conducted Electrical Weapon ( e.g.,  Taser)  \n \nKey Documentation Elements  \n• If darts removed, document the removal location in the patient care report  \n• Physical exam trauma findings  \n• Cardiac rhythm and changes  \n• Neurologic status assessment findings  \n \n \n"

Identify all sites of burn injury . If the pati ent became part of the circuit, there will be an \nadditional site near the contact with ground . Electrical burns are often full thickness and \ninvolve significant deep tissue damage, and there may be multiple burn sites  \n4. Assess for potential associated trauma  and note if the patient was thrown from contact point . \nIf patient has altered mental status, assume trauma was involved and treat accordingly  \n5. Assess for potential compartment syndrome from significant extremity tissue damage  \n6. Determine characteristics of s ource if possible  (AC or DC, voltage, amperage, time of injury ) \n \nTreatment and Intervention s \n1. Identify dysrhythmias or cardiac arrest — even patients who appear dead (particularly dilated \npupils) may have good outcomes with prompt intervention [see appropriate guideline for \nadditional information and patient assessment/treatment]  \n2. Apply spinal motion restriction if associated trauma suspec ted [ See Trauma Section ] \n3. Apply dry dressing to any wounds  \n4. Remove constricting clothing and jewelry since additional swelling is possible  \n5. Administer IV fluid resuscitation .

Conversion of electrical energy into thermal energy, causing massive tissue \ndestruction and coagulative necrosis  \nc. Mechanical injury with direct trauma resulting from falls or violent muscle contraction  \n2. Anticipate atrial and/or ventricular dysrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest  \n3. The mortality related to electrical injuries is impacted by several factors:  \na. Route current takes through the body - current traversing the heart has \nhigher mortality  \nb. Type of current  (AC vs . DC) \ni. AC is more likely to cause cardiac dysrhythmias while DC is more likely to cause \ndeep tissue burns however either type of current can cause any injury  \nii. DC typically causes one muscle contraction while AC can cause repeated \ncontracti ons \niii.

Signs and Symptoms  \na. Signs and Symptoms should support the clinician  impressions, treatment guidelines and \noverall care given. A symptom is something the patient experiences and tells the clinician ; it \nis subjective.  A sign is something the clinician  sees; it is objective.  \nb. Symptoms should not be confused with clinician  impressions. The clinician  impressions \nare the EMS working field diagnosis of the patient’s actual medical condition.  \n2. Clinician  Impressions  \na. There is often a great deal of confusion on t he part of EMS clinician s about the \ndifference between symptoms and clinician  impressions. Clinician  impressions should be \nsupported  by symptoms but not be the symptoms except on rare occasions where they \nmay be the same ( i.e., weakness when no etiology fo r the weakness can be determined \nby the EMS clinician ).  \nb. Correctly documenting impressions is essential to many aspects of EMS data use, such \nas EMS reimbursement, reports of incident types, specialty registries ( e.g.,  CARES) and \nCPI reviews. EMS agencies could literally lose money or equipment and staffing \nresources if the clinician s are incorrectly entering clinician  impressions. Addressing this \nissue should be an essential part of the record Quality Assurance and CPI process and \ndocumentation training.   \nc. Example of documenting symptoms versus impressions:  \ni. An opiate overdose patient who received naloxone and had a positive response. \nThis patient would have possible Symptoms  of altered mental status, unconscious, \nrespiratory distress, and respiratory failur e/apnea. All 4 of these symptoms are \navailable as clinician  impressions, however the correct impression for this patient \nwould be whatever variation of “Drug Overdose Opiates or Heroin” impression(s) \nare setup in the local ePCR system being used. This impr ession will specifically \ndefine the call as an overdose with opiates, rather than a case where one of the \nsymptoms was also used as an impression when the use of naloxone and other \n \n \n"

Universal Documentation Guideline  371 \nVersion 3.0 \nassessments and diagnostic tools could not determine an etiology for the \nsymptom(s).  \n \nNarrative  \nThe various data fields within the ePCR are important as they provide a means of uniformly \nentering incident data that can be used for importing into billing software or hospital records, \ntransmitting between EMS systems or creating de scriptive reports, or conducting research. In \nmost cases, at a local, state, or national level, if something wasn’t documented in the \nappropriate data field, it didn’t happen or exist.  However, the Narrative plays several essential \nroles in the PCR.  \n1. Role of the Narrative  \na. Provides an efficient and effective means to share patient information for continuity of \ncare between EMS services and EMS and hospital staff. The narrative summarizes the \nincident history and care in a manner that is easily digested between caregivers.  \nb. Provides a place for EMS to document facts that do not fit into fixed data fields. \nSpecifically, this would include the detailed history of the scene, what the patient may \nhave done or said or other aspects of thecal that only the clinician  saw, heard, or did.  \nThe Narrative is the place for the EMS clinician  to “paint the picture” for all others to \nmore fully understand the incident.  \nc. Provides a standard means to add essential details about medical history, exams, \ntreatments, patient res ponse, and changes in patient condition that can’t otherwise be \neffectively or clearly communicated.  \n2. Narrative Formats  \nDocumentation by EMS clinician s demonstrates a wide variation of training and practice \nreinforcement. Most training programs provide limited instruction on how to properly \ndocument operational and clinical processes, and almost no practice. Most clinician s learn \nthis skill on the job, and often proficient mentors are sparse. Therefore, it is essential that \nthe EMS clinician  uses a standard format to ensure they are consistent and complete in their \ndocumentation. There are three standard formats for EMS documentation. EMS clinician s \nshou ld choose the best match for them, master the format, and be consistent in its use.  \na. Medical Narrative:  This format is the one most new EMS clinician s use as it is intuitive \nand easy to learn. Some more experienced clinician s use it as they find telling the  story \nfrom start to finish works best to organize their thoughts. A drawback to this method is \nthat it is easy to forget to include facts because of the lack of structure.  \nb. SOAP:  This format stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan. This is a fo rmat \nthat is very common in the medical field.  \nc. CHART : This format stands for Complaint, History, Assessment, Rx (Treatment) and \nTransport. Each section’s content is clearly defined and consistent in format. It \nminimizes the likelihood of forgetting informa tion and ensures documentation is \nconsistent between records and clinician s. CHART is the format most recommended as \nbest practice by EMS legal authorities and is considered the standard in many EMS \nsystems. A variation is DCHART, where the “D” stands for Dispatch (reason).  \nMedications Given Showing Positive Action Using Pertinent Negatives  \nFor medications that are required by protocol ( i.e., aspirin for cardiac chest pain), pertinent \nnegatives  should be used to show that a medication protocol was considered but was satisfied \nby other than clinician  action.  \n \n \n"

The patient has already taken 324 mg \nof aspirin by the time EMS arrives per 911  pre-arrival instructions. EMS clinician s should \ndocument this as a medication given, prior -to-arrival, with the best estimated time, and qualify \nthe medication as “Medication Already Taken” using the pertinent negative.  \n \nDefinitions for Response to Medica tions  \n1. Improved :  \na.

If a patient had the intended therapeu tic response to the medication, but a side effect \nthat caused a clinical deterioration in another body system, then \"Improved\" should be \nchosen and the side effects documented as a complication ( i.e., nitroglycerin improved \nchest pain but dropped the blood  pressure).  \n2.

In the case of worsening condition, documentation of the procedure complications may \nalso be appropriate.  \nc. NOTE: Just because a patient got worse, doesn’t necessarily mean the clinician  \nperformed the procedure incorrectly.  \nNEMSIS Data Standards and Limitations  \n1. NEMSIS is a national dataset and standard used by all EMS software systems. (For additional \ninformatio n, go to www.nemsis.org .) Currently there are three versions of the data standard \navailable for documentation and in which data is stored:  \na. NEMSIS Version 2.2.1 (v2.2.1)  \ni. Adopted in 2006, there have been no changes since release  \nii. Most states or systems have used this standard since i ts release, and the majority of \nmost states’ data available since approximately 2016 is in this format.  \niii. NEMSIS accepted v2.2.1 data through 12/31/2016, and some states may continue to \ncollect data in this standard until they transition to NEMSIS v3 standar ds. \nb. NEMSIS Version 3 (v3)  \ni. NEMSIS v3 was created and finalized in 2011 to replace v2.2.1 in order to allow the \ndataset to become more flexible for updates and adopt technical standards making \nlinkage to other health records possible.  \n1. NEMSIS v3.3.4 was relea sed in March 2014 and was the first version in \nproduction where live data was collected by services and states and \nsubsequently submitted to NEMSIS.  NEMSIS will continue to accept v3.3.4 data \nuntil 12/31/2017.  \n2. NEMSIS v3.4, released in March 2015, included both changed elements and \nmany added values to existing elements. NEMSIS has been accepting data from \nthis version concurrently with V3.3.4 data. As of August 2021 , v3.4 will be the \nonly standard and V3.3.4 will be phased out. All documentation guidelines \nfound in this document are based on the NEMSIS v3.4 dataset and standard.  \n2. Mandatory and Required Elements  \nb. Mandatory:  NEMSIS makes certain elements or fields mandatory so, if not included, the \nrecord cannot be properly stored or moved electronically. These fields require real data \nand do not accept Nil (Blank) values, Not Values, or Pertinent Negatives.  \nc. Required:  NEMSIS requires these elements or fields to be completed or the record \ncannot be properly stored or moved electronically. However, required fields allow Nil \n(blank) values, Not Values, or Pertinent Negatives to be entered and submitted.  \n \n \n"

State and local systems may have Mandatory or Required fields that are not Mandatory \nor Required by NEMSIS. The manager for these systems should be contacted for a li st of \nthese fields.  \n3. Not Values, Nil, and Pertinent Negatives  \nb. Not Values (NV), Nil, and Pertinent Negatives (PN) are values that are attributes of \ncertain NEMSIS elements designed to clarify a null data entry or qualify data entry into \nthe element with whic h the NV, Nil, or PN is associated.  \nc. Not Values available are “Not Applicable” and “Not Recorded”  \ni. Some NEMSIS rules require one of these values to be entered when data is \nimported/exported if there is no other data in a field ( e.g.,  at least one medication  \ngiven must have a value, if no medications are given, then the software system must \ninsert “Not Applicable” in the medications field when exporting)  \nii. At times the EMS clinician  use of “Not Applicable” is appropriate documentation \n(e.g., using “Not Applicable” under eInjury.03 —Trauma Center Criteria , per the ACS -\nCOT 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients , when \ntransporting a patient with a simple sprained ankle)  \nd. Nil Values are blank values  \ni. Values can be lef t blank, which can either be an accidental or purposeful omission of \ndata.  \nii. Value fields can appropriately and purposefully be left blank if there was nothing to \nenter ( e.g.,  a procedure field left blank if no patient was encountered).  \ne. Pertinent Negatives are attributes or qualifiers for both elements and fields. There are \n11 possible Pertinent Negative values and the available list for each field varies as \nappropriate to the  field. Two examples of the use of Pertinent Negatives are:  \ni. Documenting non -administration of ASA for chest pain by the EMS clinician  with the \nPertinent Negative of “Medication Already Taken” to show evidence that this \ntreatment requirement was met.  \nii. Docume nting assessment of, and lack of a gunshot wound to the chest with the \nqualifier of “Chest --> gunshot wound --> Exam Finding Not Present” in the \nexamination section (previously you could only document a positive finding of a \ngunshot wound with was no way to document that you looked and did not find \none).  \n4. NEMSIS Element and Value Name Formats  \nb. NEMSIS Elements/Fields are organized into groups with other related elements/fields  \ni. There are two parent datasets: Demographic (designated by a “d”) and EMS \n(designat ed by an “e”). The majority of the documentation in any ePCR falls in the \n“e” section. The Demographic dataset is intended to be descriptive of the EMS \nagencies and system characteristics for correlation at a larger research level, rather \nthan for use in o perational CPI reviews.  \nii. The element numbering structure reflects the dataset and the text group name of \nthe element  \n5. Example: “eVitals.06 —SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure)” where “e” is the EMS dataset and \n“Vitals” is the dataset grouping for all elements rel ated to Vitals and the number is the \nnumber assigned to a specific element.  \nb. “eVitals.06” is used to store the data in the background and “SBP (Systolic Blood \nPressure)” is what clinician s and reviewers see.  \nc. Values are designated by a code and text name.  \n \n \n"

The codes are generally derived from various sources such as ICD -10, SNOMED, or \nRxNorm and are used to store and move the data in the system’s background.  \nii. Codes are not seen by the EMS clinician  in the ePCR, but rather the clinician  will see \ntext names.  \nSome software systems allow the visible text name to be modified or relabeled to \nmeet local standards or nomenclature; This feature can help improve data quality \nby making documentation easier for the clinician . \niii. An example of a value code and name for card iac chest pain, found under the \nelement “eProtocols.01 —Protocols Used” is “9914117 – Medical -Cardiac Chest \nPain”.  \nd. All minimum general documentation guideline requirements are identified using the \nNEMSIS element, values codes, and names to allow application  across a variety of ePCR \nsoftware labels for these fields.  \n6. Custom Elements/Fields and Values  \nb. The NEMSIS Standard provides a data format for software vendors to create custom \nelements or values requested by states or local systems.  \nc. States or local systems may create new elements or value extensions for existing \nNEMSIS elements to meet regional needs ( e.g.,  adding additional protocol name values \nnot on the NEMSIS list).  \nAirway Confirmation Fields  \nSpecific use of the NEMSIS airway confirmation fields in documentation will not be detailed at \nthis time due to current operational and technical challenges all states, local systems, and ePCR \nsoftware vendors are experiencing.  \nThe NEMSIS airway confirmation fields were closely modeled on the “Recommended Gu idelines \nfor Uniform Reporting of Data from Out -of-Hospital Airway Management: Position Statement of \nthe National Association of EMS Physicians” and the fields and values could provide excellent \nand appropriately useful data to evaluate airway management. However, the technical structure \nof the fields has made their practical use limited as all the data is collected as a separate, self -\ncontained group, rather than as part of the procedures group. This means EMS clinician s would \nneed to enter much of the sam e information twice in the ePCR, in both the procedures area and \nairway confirmation section (when, who did it, what device was used, and complications).  \nFurthermore, the airway group can only be entered once per e PCR, so the fields cannot be used \nagain if more than one airway was required ( e.g.,  one airway became ineffective and needed to \nbe replaced with a different type of airway). Many states and ePCR software vendors have been \nstruggling with how to make these fields functional for use by only using a portion of them or \nlooking to add mirrored custom values that are directly linked to procedures performed. \nHowever, solutions are currently far from practical, functional, effective, or uniform in how they \nare being implemented or used across vario us systems.  \n \nReferences   \n1.

Evidence -Based Guidelines: GRADE Methodology  406 \nVersion 3.0 \n \nVIII. Evidence -Based Guidelines:  GRADE Methodology  \nAn Overview of GRADE Methodology  \n \nAlthough engagement in quality EMS research has increased significantly, the demand for evidence -\nbased quality prehospital research continues to exceed its availability. The need for evidence -based \nprehospital patient care protocols was clearly recognized by the Institute of Medicine of the \nNational Academies and clearly stated in 2007 in The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical \nServices at the Crossroads.  \n \nThe Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) \nmethodology is  a transparent process where the available research is reviewed and assessed by a \npanel of subject matter experts. Following this thorough review process, the available research is \nreviewed and graded for its validity based upon the assessment of the workg roup, and an evidence -\nbased guideline (EBG) is developed based upon the outcome of the workgroup.   \n \nThe Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) and the National EMS \nAdvisory Council (NEMSAC) approved a National Prehospital Evidence -based Guideline Model \nProcess for the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence -based guidelines. This \nModel Process recommends the use of the GRADE methodology for the guideline development tool. \nThe six process steps of  the GRADE EBG development tool are:  \n \n• Assemble the expert panel and provide GRADE training  \n• Define the EBG content area and establish the specific clinical questions to address in patient, \nintervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format  \n• Prioritize outco mes to facilitate systematic literature searches  \n• Create GRADE tables (or evidence profiles) for each PICO question  \n• Vet and endorse GRADE evidence tables and draft recommendations  \n• Synthesize recommendations into an EMS protocol and visual algorithm  \n \nSome  evidence -based guidelines cited in this document were created for and released by NHTSA; \nhowever, the GRADE methodology is not proprietary to NHTSA or any other organization. Local, \nregional, and state EMS agencies and EMS systems are encouraged to support t he ongoing need for \nquality prehospital care, improved patient outcome, and the growing demand for EBGs for EMS.   \n \nReferences:  \nBrown KM.
