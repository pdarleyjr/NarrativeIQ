Compressions are delivered on the lower third of the sternum to a depth of approximately 1/3 of the anterior - posterior diameter of the chest. Because the 2 - thumb technique generates higher blo od pressures and coronary perfusion pressure with less rescuer fatigue, the 2- thumb - encircling hands technique is suggested as the preferred method. Use a 3:1 ratio of compressions to ventilation with 90 compressions and 30 breaths per minute. Allow the chest to re - expand during relaxation without letting your thumbs leave the chest. k. Establish umbilical v ascular access (UVA) cannulating th e umbilical vein. Keep in mind that the priority is the airway. IV access is a secondary concern. l. If CPR fails to establish a pulse of at least 100 bpm, consider the following treatments via the umbilical vascular access where applicable: 1) Administer epinephrine 1: 1 0,000 , 0.01 m g/kg Umbilical vascular access (0.1 mL/kg) OR as per the pediatric medication guide. May repeat every 3 to 5 minutes. 2) If the pulse is 60 bpm or less administer atropine sulfate , 0 .02 mg/kg OR a s per the pediatric medication guide. Um bilical vascular access for increased vagal tone or primary AV block. May repeat once. Minimum dose 0.1 mg and maximum single dose 1.0 mg. 3) Fluid bolus n ormal saline , 10 mL/kg Umbilical vascular access . 4) For suspected narcotic overdose, administer naloxone (Narcan) , 0.1 mg/kg Umbilical vascu lar access OR as per the pediatric medication guide. May repeat in 2 minutes if necessary.

EMS COMMON P ROTOCOLS MEDICATIONS FENTANYL Page 1 of 2 383 FEN TANYL Fentanyl is a strong opioid medication that is 80 to 100 times more potent by weight than morphine. Like other narcotics it may cause mood alterations, drowsiness and either euphoria (up feeling) or dysphoria (down feeling). Also like other opioids, Fentanyl can cause respiratory depression and will stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone which may lead to nausea and vomiting. It’s main advantage in the pre - hospital situation is that it may be given intra - nasally and therefore can be useful in managing pain in those patients in whom vascular access is not immediately available. Once vascular access is established and if the patient continues with significant pain (Pain score of 6 or more on a 1 to 10 scale), Morphine may be given to a patient who has received IntraNasal Fentanyl. Indications • Relief of m oderate to severe pain in those patients in whom vascular access in not readily available. Onset and Duration • Rapid o nset following IV or IntraNasal administration. • Duration 30 - 60 minutes. Precautions/Contraindications • As wit h an y opioid medication, the patient’s respiratory status, SpO 2 , blood pressure, and mental status should be regularly monitored after administration for pain control. • Should NOT be given if the patient is hypotensive for their age. • Shoul d NOT be given if the patient appears to be under the influence of other drugs or alcohol. • S houl d NOT be given to patients whose respiratory status is already compromised for example, patients with CHF, asthma, or COPD. • S houl d NOT be given to patients who have experienced head trauma and have altered mental status. • Pa tients whose blood pressure drops after receiving Fentanyl should be given a bolus of normal saline :  Adult NS bol us Dose : 500 mL IV .

In addit ion, it potentiates vascular smooth muscle relaxation by beta - adrenergic antagonist and may alter airway hyperactivity. While the exact mechanism of corticosteroid activity is unknown, these agents decrease inflammatory and immune responses by stabilizing membranes within white blood cells responding to a site of infection, injury, irritation, or inflammation. Indications • Alle rgic reaction – Anaphylaxis • Respiratory distress – COPD – Severe asthma (Solu - Medrol should be given to only acute patients that are in moderate to severe distress). Contraindications • Pa tients allergic to any component of the formulation.

Pre cautions/Contraindications Should NOT be given to patients with the following conditions. • Becker or D uchenne muscular dystrophy • Cerebral palsy patients with paralysis • 48 - 72 hours after major burns, multiple trauma, paralyzing stroke, or spinal cord injury. • Extensive crush injury with suspected rhabdomyolysis. • History of malignant hyperthermia in the patient or their family. • Hyperkalemia —suspect in renal dialysis patients with peaked T waves, widened QRS complex, loss of P waves. Onset and Duration • Rapid ons et of effect within 30 - 60 seconds. • Short duration of action 4 to 6 minutes. • After administration it is common to see muscle twitching for seconds until the onset of complete paralysis. Dosage Adult • 2 m g/kg IV Pediatric • 2 mg/kg IV All patients that receive succinylcholine should also receive a benzodiazepine to provide sedation and amnesia. Ketamine can also be used for this purpose. Etomidate is also u seful, but is short acting. No pat ient should EVER be paralyzed with medications and still alert. Suc cinylcholine does not provide any analgesia. Patients with obvious pain should also receive pain medications.

The noninvasive pressure support (PEEP) via the CPAP splints the airways open with positive pressure, thus increasing the surface area for gas exchange at the alveolar/capillary membrane and reducing atelectasis from the “wash - out” affect of surfactant. The outcome should be to increase lung volume, improve oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing, therefore decreasing the incidence of intubation. CPAP may also decrease the need for repeated doses of the drugs used in cardiogenic pulmonary edema patients. The use of CPAP should not preclude the use of other treatments, when indic ated based on the patient’s presentation, according to Protocol. Consult with the Radio Physician, as needed. Respiratory Status : CPAP does not take the place of bag -valve- mask ventilation for the patient who is no longer able to breathe on their own or has minimally effective breathing. If the patient’s breathing status improves after positive ventilation assistance with BVM so that the ability to breathe on their own is regained, CPAP can then be added as a treatment, Mental Status: The pa tient must be awake and aware and be able to cooperate and follow directions. They may be presenting with major respiratory distress, but if able to follow commands, CPAP may be used. Patient Cooperation: To i ncrease success, be sure to communicate with the patient that the mask may be uncomfortable but will assist their breathing and prevent them from being intubated. You must get the patient's cooperation and acceptance through communication. Monitor the patient (i.e. respiratory rate and effort, breath sounds, pulse ox)! A patient that is not responding, worsening, or cannot tolerate the device should have the CPAP mask removed and appropriate treatment initiated. 2022 - 24 Common EM S Protocols - Coral Gables, Hialeah, Miami, Miami Beach, and Key Biscayne.

Do NOT w aste your time trying to obtain a blood pressure. Listen for HUM at the apex of the heart under the left breast. If there is a HUM then the pat ient has bl ood flow, even if there is no palpable pulse regardless of the patient’s level of con sciousness. An awake, al ert patient complaining of being “weak and dizzy” can be VF.
