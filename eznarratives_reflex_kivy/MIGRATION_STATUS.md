2. **Mobile Integration**
    - iOS-specific UI components refined
    - Tab navigation with iOS HIG compliance optimized

3. **Testing**
    - End-to-end tests for user flows implemented with Puppeteer
    - All test suites now complete

4. **CI/CD**
    - GitHub Actions workflows implemented for all platforms:
      - Web (ci-web.yml)
      - iOS (ci-ios.yml)
      - Android (ci-android.yml)
      - Desktop (ci-desktop.yml)

## Next Steps

All planned migration tasks have been completed! The next steps would be:

1. Test on actual mobile devices
2. Optimize performance
3. Conduct user acceptance testing
4. Gather user feedback and implement improvements
