## Next Steps

Before deploying to production, you should:

1. **Create GitHub Environments**
   - Set up a "production" environment in your GitHub repository settings
   - Add the required secrets for deployment:
     - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
     - `HOST`
     - `SSH_USER`
     - `DOMAIN`
     - `SLACK_WEBHOOK` (optional for notifications)

2. **Prepare Hostinger VPS**
   - Set up the server according to the deployment guide
   - Install required software (Node.js, Python, Nginx/Apache)
   - Configure SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt

3. **Test Deployment Locally**
   - Build the application with production settings
   - Test the application with production environment variables
   - Verify all features work correctly in production mode

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - Follow the steps in `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Verify the deployment using the deployment check page
   - Monitor logs for any errors

All configuration files have been updated to follow best practices for production deployment on a Hostinger VPS, with a focus on security, performance, and reliability.
